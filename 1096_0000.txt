"All right," says Bina.

"What?"

"I said alright, that's enough arguing. I'll go with Kendra."

[k]"Woah, hey, you should stay with Amie. I'll - "[/k]

"I seem to remember you telling me that you weren't going to leave me behind," says Bina, not looking at Kendra. "You walking that back on me now?"

[k]"No, but-"[/k]

"Good," says Bina. "So that's settled."

"What about you Emmie?"

"I - I mean - Melissa is my friend," says Emmie. "I - I guess I will come with you."

"You'd be safer with Amie."

"Even so," says Emmie."

"All right then."

"Now wait a second-" starts Edwards. 

"Do we really have time for people to be saying 'Now wait a second' in that particular argumentative tone of voice?" asks Bina, cutting her off. "Unless you're actually going to shoot us, we are going and we are going [i]now[/i]."

"It's just [i]crazy[/i]," says Edwards. "You're all crazy."

"Sure," says Bina. "But what was it about this situation that made you think that [i]any[/i] of this was [i]sane?[/i]"

Bina turns to Amie in the doorway, "Are you going to be OK?"

"I - yeah," says Amie. "I think - I mean, yes. I'll be fine. We'll find out where they're coming from and stop them."

"Good," says Bina. "The Naughts, they're strong, and fast, faster then they should be, but they're not smart. You can trap them, block them in, confuse them."

"I know."

"I know you know."

Amie smiles at that.

"One last thing," says Bina. "They might not be the sharpest knife in the drawer but they're not [i]alone[/i]. If I'm right, Gregor is down here somewhere, and if we're very [i]very[/i] unlucky, he's brought his dog with him. Be careful."

And with that, everyone starts to move.
