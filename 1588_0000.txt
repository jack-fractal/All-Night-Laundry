>>>NOTES:

I know a lot of people were hoping there would be a full dream sequence here, and I would have liked to have one too, they're some of my favorite parts of the story.

But there's only one left that's actually important, and it's one I've had planned for years. Any dream I put in here now would just be filler. All the pieces are on the board. They're just not in the right places yet.

So! No dream this time, but there is one in the works. Probably after all this [i]lego[/i] nonsense.
