"OK, we're going to go slow and quiet," whispers Amie. "We're not going to spook them and, and this is very important and I need you all to listen, we are not going to [i]shoot[/i] them. OK? Because we might hit the people they've grabbed [i]and[/i] because they don't really seem impressed with bullets."

The two police officers grumble an agreement while Elizabeth nods.

"Go team!" whispers Amie, trying to ignore the exasperated groan behind her from the police.

A few moments of creeping forward leads them to a door, slightly open.

The groans of the naughts mixed with some hollow banging emerge from the small space between the jam and the door.

"They're in there!" whispers Amie.

Amie reaches out to the door to push it open -

"What do we do if they spot us?"

"We run!" whispers Amie, annoyed.

She reaches out again.

"You saw how fast that thing was. You really think 'run' is going to cut it?"

"Fine, I have a better plan, we'll run [i]really fast.[/i] Now shh!"

Amie reaches out -
