The phone is not wireless. It is an old-school 'stand here and talk' kind of deal. She decides to be adventurous and head for the bag.

She very nearly loses the IV stand right away as her landing knee protests at the very idea of bending in a useful way and she discovers the hard way that the stand is on wheels.

Leaning on the IV stand and trying not to bend her knees, she waddles to the bag.
