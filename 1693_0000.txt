Right! 

[quote="auronblidook"]Just grab one key. That'll be less likely to generate paradox.[/quote]

Good plan!

[quote="Nick"]Amie - is there a master key behind the desk? that would be much more practical than carrying around a dozen individual room keys, and would be way better in the even you need to get into a room quickly[/quote]

Better plan!

Amie quickly scans the rows of keys until she finds one in the corner, marked with something other than a room number.

She grabs it and puts it into her pocket next to the Dead Moment.

To her right are the elevators, behind her is a room that appears to be a drawing-room or waiting area, but Amie can see a door covered in a tattered piece of cloth that might lead to a service hallway.
