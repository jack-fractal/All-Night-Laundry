For a second there is stillness. The uncomfortable sensation of being somewhere hot and wet, like the inside of something's mouth, snaps off like a lightbulb. 

The cool breese of an early spring afternoon ruffles through her hair. 

Bina feels a moment of pure joy and elation. That instant of victory a small furry thing feels when the beast of horn and muscle and murderous intent, so hot on their heels only an instant before, leaps for their throat... and misses.
