"She's a goofy little dog isn't she? Always getting into everything, always trying to eat anything you put in front of her, even things she really [i]shouldn't[/i] eat? That thing out there - it just does what you say, right? It doesn't play, it doesn't bark, it doesn't even growl. It's just a [i]weapon[/i]."

"You are trying to make me angry. I do not know why but it will not -"

"It is not, [i]true.[/i]"

"I'm the special one Gregor. Not [i]you[/i]."
