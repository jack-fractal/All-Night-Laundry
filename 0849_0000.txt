This is somewhat after that. That incident had involved very little running and hardly any screaming at all, but [i]had[/i] involved a good deal of shivering and damp.

[k]"So T-three is kinda a j-j-jerk, right?"[/k]

"S-s-so many l-l-l-leggo's..."

But this scene with the time machines takes place later, in the moment about six perceptual hours, but only thirty real-world minutes. They are both dry and warm and in Kendra's case, wearing fresh clothes.

[k]"[i]Why[/i] do you need a time machine Bina?"[/k]

"Because I need to be there to catch her!"

[k]"No you don't, we can just grab her from this end. It's a time machine, it works both ways."[/k]

"But we don't know her exact location, AND we don't know exactly [i]when[/i] she falls."

[k]"Yeah, but - "[/k]

"And we can't leave the portal open for very long! We go back down in the crane almost right away, and even with my hair in the way, I'd see a honking great portal."

As it turns out, Bina is very wrong about this.

[k]"So if it needs someone to target it, it should be me who goes then."[/k]

"Why?"

[k]"Well for starters, all of [i]my[/i] ribs are intact."[/k]

"I'm fine! My ribs hardly hurt anymore."

[k]"That's not the point."[/k]

"Well what [i]is[/i] the point then?"

[k]"The point is Bina, you're not invincible!"[/k]
