[quote="Stillwaters"]So, first off, let me say this webcomic is awesome. To the point that I ended up reading it start to finish, without stopping, after I first found it this weekend (24 hours straight, if you are curious, with breaks for food and restroom).[/quote]

Holy crap! Are you all right? That's... a lot reading at a desk. I am honored, but also concerned for you.
