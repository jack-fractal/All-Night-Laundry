[quote="AlteranAngel"]Emmie> Sit up. As you do this your hand brushes against an object you cannot quite identify immediately (without having looked down) because you're still a bit hazy after the explosion / timeline travel thing. The object can either be A) The stuffed beaver toy. B) Gregor's watch.[/quote]

"Uuuugh..." groans Emmie. "I think - what - what am I touching?"

"Oh. You OK Kendra?" 

[k]"I feel like someone just pulled me apart and put me back together again with all my bits on backwards."[/k]

"You look OK from here," says Emmie. "I... think."

[k]"Well good, 'cause relearning how to walk with my knees on the wrong way 'round wasn't on my to-do list."[/k]

"How many more times do we have to do that?" asks Emmie, dreading the answer. 

"At least ten!" says Bina.

Emmie tries, and fails, to stifle a groan.

"[i]Then[/i] we have to do the actual hard bit."

[k]"Don't worry,"[/k] says Kendra, trying to sit up. [k]"We're probably going to die before we get that far."[/k]

"Good," says Emmie. "I was hoping you'd say that."
