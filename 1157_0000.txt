[quote="Batness"]Bina: keep talking to Gregor! That's what works in negotiations, *and* villains always like to talk about their plan. Or at least slip up when trying NOT to spill.[/quote]

"Gregor -" Bina starts, but is immediately cut off. 

"Hey!" calls Emmie 

"What?" asks Bina.

[quote="Fellow"]Aren't there more naughts in the building, ready to sneak up on you?[/quote]

[quote='btp']> Wait...now that there's one less generator, you hear...is that Amie shouting?[/quote]

"Oh no..." moans Castillo, leaning heavily on Emmie's shoulder.

[e]"I'm gonna need those handcuffs [i]now[/i],"[/e] says Elizabeth.
