"I wonder what he meant about the watch," says Emmie.

"He has to be talking about the Moment," says Bina. "But Three is the one who made it, and he's never had it... I don't think. If he had it, why put it back in the globe?"

"Maybe the cops have it?" suggests Emmie. "They have his clothes..."

[k]"I dunno - wherever it is, he seemed pretty serious about getting it back."[/k]
