Haha! 

Hahahaha! 

That sure looks like what they did!

Yeah, that would be a not-so-very-good-at-all idea. Not happening. She'll jump out the window first.

With [i]zombies[/i] outside? You realize this is totally a point where zombies happen, right? Bina has actually [i]already been through that bit[/i] and it sucked the first, like, [i]five times[/i].

Bina closes the door and retreats into the room.
