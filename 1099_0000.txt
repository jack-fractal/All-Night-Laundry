[k]"So that means one of [i]us[/i] is the Doctor!"[/k]

"All right..."

[k]"Hmmm... I'm not sure which one of us it is though. I mean... I was the one with the time machine, but you have your whole [i]arm[/i] thing. It could be either of us. It's probably you."[/k]

"It's probably [i]you[/i]," says Bina. "You're the one who built the time machine. You're the one who dropped into her appartment and whisked her away. I was unconscious baggage at that point."

"I would like to point out that I am the only one here who is [i]actually[/i], you know, a Doctor," says Emmie. "By trade."

"I just thought it needed saying," says Emmie. "We go right here, I think."

"It could be any of us," says Bina. "But right now, we have a job to do, a job we should be doing considerably more quietly then we have been. Precisely who is who doesn't really matter right now."

[k]"Well it doesn't really matter for [i]us[/i],"[/k] says Kendra.
