"I - err... well this is all crazy complicated now your sister and your, uh, friend are here."

[k]"Well, I didn't know anyone else willing to break medical ethics to help me."[/k]

"I'm not criticising! I just, I mean, lying to Elizabeth is one thing but lying to family?"

[k]"So, wait, you think we [i]should[/i] tell them?"[/k]

[quote=Beastnix;7902273]>Well telling them also sucks anyway, they'll think we are both crazy, most anyone would.[/quote]

"Yes? I don't know. They're going to think we're [i]super bonkers[/i]?"

[k]"Well, my sister already thinks I'm bonkers, so I'm one step ahead."[/k]

"You know what I mean."

[k]"We could show them your arm. That's pretty convincing. It convinced me."[/k]

[quote=a52;7902406]>Wait, they haven't seen Bina's wrist yet?[/quote]

"So they [i]haven't[/i] seen this?"

[k]"No, I replaced the bandages myself, and THAT was an argument and a half, let me tell you. I'm pretty sure they think you have some kind of [i]tracking device[/i] in your arm, or you [i]did[/i] and I pulled it out with pliers or something."[/k]

"What? Why?!"

[k]"Well, they're not idiots, and not to put too fine a point on it, you look like you've been through the wringer. You have two broken ribs, bad bruises up your hips and side, scrapes and bumps all over, and there's the whole infection thing. Nobody without a very compelling reason would let an infection get that bad before going to see a doctor. Nobody."[/k]

"It was that bad?"

[k]"It was that bad."[/k]

"Oh."

[k]"And [i]then[/i] I told them that you were in trouble, that they shouldn't enter you into the hospital system like a normal patient, and that there was a very scary Russian guy who might come after you. I told them he's armed and [i]very dangerous[/i] and that they should not, under any circumstances, confront him. All that sounds bad, but then I also told them that they couldn't go to the police, and I think they may have started making some assumptions."[/k]

"Err, wait, so...? They think I'm some kind of [i]human trafficking[/i] victim?"

[k]"They haven't exactly [i]asked[/i], but yeah, I'm pretty sure that's what they're thinking."[/k]
