[quote=tegerioreo;7629473]Kendra:  Conclude that Specimen 2-4 probably grew into adulthood with a normal, uncluttered chest cavity.  Also assume that 7-12 must have had a normal arm to go with his un-atrophied muscles.  The event that caused the deformities probably also killed them.

Kendra:  Come down with a severe case of [b]The Creeps[/b].[/quote]

OK. Gettin' the creeps. Reeeeally gettin' the creeps.
