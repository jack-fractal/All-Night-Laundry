My hand is fine. If I don't think about it, it doesn't hurt nearly at all.

Really. It's all good.

I mean, ok, it's a kind of supernatural gateway or conduit to some horrible Other, an alien maybe, or a demon or a god.

And it's maybe turning me into a monster, or doing something horrible to my history...

Twisting me up somehow.

Making me [i]wrong[/i].

But if I ignore it, don't think about it too much, focus on other things like running from Horatio, or hiding, or talking to Kendra, it's almost like none of that is happening.

You can get used to [i]anything[/i], given enough time.
