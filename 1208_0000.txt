[quote="Juddy555"]>Bina: "I agree, we kind of have shanked time too many times just to travel between the holes we make."[/quote]

"Err... yeah. I mean, OK." says Bina. "We've poked enough holes in time for a while. I think we'll probably have to use the Moment a bit though, right? We're kinda running low on hours in the day here."

[k]"Maybe?"[/k] says Kendra, not sounding confident. [k]"I don't know Bina."[/k]

"I know it makes a weak spot but-"

[k]"No, it's not that,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"It's just... I mean, the gifts from the botfly. They're bad news right? Josephine's energy generation stuff was a trick, the naughts are terrible and I'm pretty sure [i]not[/i] what Gregor really wanted, and, no offense Amie, but I'm pretty sure that whole situation in the basement would not have played out how it did without you being there."[/k]

"I guess," says Amie, and then she sighs. "I mean, yeah. Yeah, probably not."

[k]"I'm just saying we shouldn't be using them."[/k]

"Okay," says Bina, not getting it. 

[k]"Which means we shouldn't use time travel,"[/k] says Kendra, giving Bina a concerned look.
