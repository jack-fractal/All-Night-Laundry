"You look very pale, are you feeling dizzy?"

"A little."

"OK, tell me if you're feeling faint, and if you feel like you're going to pass out, try to tip sideways and not forwards, OK? Cracking your chin on the floor wouldn't be a great addition to the situation I don't think."

With how deep this is, it might have chipped a bone or compromised one of your tendons, which, considering where it is, could do some nasty things to your foot if we left it alone."

"An x-ray?"

"Yes."

"I don't know if I have time..."

"This is... pretty important. You have a puncture wound, they can be really nasty."
