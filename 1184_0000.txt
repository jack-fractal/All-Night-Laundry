Yeah, this was one of those things were I just sorta messed up. I needed to end the chapter here, this is the end of a chapter, we're going into a very different scene buuuuut I kinda blew the only falling event on that gag with the raining Doctors.

I like that gag, but I could have probably used that moment to end the chapter, kept the thematic throughline for the chapter end pages and let the chaos and confusion that resulted from that whole situation be inferred by context. 

It wouldn't have been as clear, and the beat with Bina staring blankly [i]is[/i] really important... so it's kinda a toss up.

C'est le vie. This is Calvinball, sometimes we compromise.
