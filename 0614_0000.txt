"Josephine!"I can't keep the exasperation out of my voice any-more. I have had just about enough of her jerking me around. "Come [i]on[/i]."

[color=#94846F]"I don't know! All right?!"[/color] Her voice has crept up half an octave. [color=#94846F]"Is that what you want to hear me say? I don't [i]know[/i]! Are you happy now? The other you got very huffy at me about that as well. I really don't appreciate it, [i]thank you very much[/i]."[/color]

She crosses her arms over her chest and looks away. I don't know what I expected from this woman, but it wasn't petulance.

I need to know about the actual experiment, but something feels off. The wind has died away and the air is hot and still. The smooth rumble of the skyships engines has picked up a stuttering whine.

I'd felt a soft furry weight appear on my feet about ten minutes ago. I look down. Piotyr's worried face looks up at me.

I'm worried too girl.

God, this poor dog. 

None of us deserve any of this, not even Josephine, but [i]you[/i] deserve it least of all. 

I wonder how much of what is going on you even understand.

I loop a finger in her collar. Whatever is going to happen here, and something [i]is[/i] going to happen, I'm getting a sense for these things. I don't want to lose her.

I [i]should[/i] leave now, figure out some way to wake up from all this. Why is Kendra letting me sleep this long?

But not yet. There are still things I need to know.

I turn back to Josephine, and I ask the questions.

[quote=curiousTerminal;7742656]I think you put Josephine's color on the last line instead of Bina's? It reads that way to me anyway.[/quote]

I did! Fixed! Merci!

[quote=elementaryMydear;7742890]> Wait, but Josephine, the [i]very[/i] first time we met (that is, not original me, but the me I am now, when [i]we[/i] met for the first time from my perspective), back when you weren't dead, you said that you needed a huge crowd because the experiment made very little energy. With the huge crowd you got in the past you said you were going to make forty watts. Now you're saying that more than a handful of people generates so much energy that the equipment [i]melts?[/i] Or was this big crowd you spoke of that time not the big crowd I thought it was?

[quote]This experiment? It makes maybe forty watts. That's if she's lucky. It turns on a lightbulb. That's it.[/quote][/quote]

Yes! Someone asked this question. 

I was sitting there doing math two days ago going 'Jack, you do not need to do this, nobody will notice or care!' and then you did! 

VINDICATION!

You will get your answer tomorrow.
