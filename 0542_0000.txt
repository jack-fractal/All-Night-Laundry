"What!?"

[k]"I think we could do it with maybe just a bunch of wire."[/k]

"What? How?"

[quote=BreadProduct;7698261]Would a Foxhole Radio work?

[k]"I think - no, I [i]know[/i] - a way to make a really crappy radio that doesn't need a power supply. Like, the hand-made kind. They are not good radios, but I think it might work."[/k]

"This isn't a radio Kendra. This is a [i]time machine[/i]."

[k]"I know! But, look, we could make the receiver, and for the tuner we'd just need something with medium resistance. A piece of metal maybe."[/k]

"Are you sure?"

[k]"Maaaaybe? But Bina, this is -[/k]

"But this is time travel, I know, ok, what about the paradox?"

[k]"Could we break the shard in half and use the second half as a ground? I know it's not from the future but - [/k]

"I think that's... a bad idea. We should avoid breaking the shard unless absolutely necessary." Bina thinks about the TV thing again and continues, "They do weird stuff when they're broken."

[k]"All right... we could just ground it into the mud? It wouldn't be [i]safe[/i] but nothing about this is remotely safe."[/k]

"If we can't come up with a better plan, but Kendra are you sure this is a good idea? I bet there's radios and stuff back at the camp."

[k]"Yeah, but to get them we'd have to, you know, go back to the camp. That didn't go so well for me the last time."[/k]

"Or maybe we could find somewhere else, I mean, this place is a factory, right? There's bound to be stuff all over the place. Heck, we could probably find some stuff in the garage downstairs, right? I mean, I don't think...

[k]"You don't think...? You don't think what?"[/k]

"Do you hear that?"

[k]"Hear what?"[/k]

"[i]That![/i]"

[k]"Ohhhh dang. I know those moans."[/k]

"I told you they could find me! We shouldn't have stayed in one place this long!"

[quote=wolftamer9;7696107]What?! No X-Ray gun?! How could you forget, Kendra???[/quote]
[quote=xooxu;7698780]Was Kendra not able to grab the x-ray machine?[/quote]

Yeah, Kendra didn't grab the portable x-ray. She wanted too, but Horatio was intent on the whole 'murdering her' thing so she had to leave it behind. 

She also really wanted some duct-tape, but that didn't work out either.

Had we found a way to disable or delay Horatio, then she would have been able to get those items, but alas, such was not the case.
