[quote="Ayla"]Kendra: Bina herself has/had no reason to kill those people either! Plus, you know that Bina wouldn't really kill anyone, right?[/quote]

[quote="tinwatchman"]> Kendra: Call bullshit. Bina hasn't used the power of time travel to hurt anyone. She's used it to **save** people. Like Elizabeth.[/quote]

[k]"Why... would [i]you[/i] kill them? I've just spent quite some time, subjectively, watching you do the craziest bullshit imaginable to save people who you hardly even [i]know[/i]. It's nearly killed you, a lot, but you keep doing it! I'm sorry, but you're not the murderer type."[/k]

"I don't [i]want[/i] to be," says Bina. "But Kendra - if the people in the factory survive, then the experiment will be a success. Josephine will have proved that her device works and she'll show everyone, the Royal Society, heck - the whole world. Everyone. Everyone! You know how that ends, that ends with the Botfly waking up a hundred years ago. She'll go whatever the early 1900's version of viral is."

[k]"Bina - but - so you think - but if [i]you[/i] did that - it doesn't - look,"[/k] says Kendra, not able to thread a complete sentence together. She stops for a second, sighs, and then tries again. [k]"If that's how it happened, we wouldn't exist, which means we couldn't go back and prevent it."[/k]

[quote="ForestGardener"]Dammit Bina, loose end "paradoxes" are the type that causes brain damage! Why would you propose one of that magnitude?! [/quote]

[k]"Our timeline could never have happened, which means we would never have been in a position to prevent the Botfly version of the twentieth century from happening, on account of us not - you know - [i]being alive[/i]. Which means it could never not happen![/k] That last sentence sounded weird. Kendra goes back over it quickly. No, it's correct, it's just [i]horrible[/i]. The things time travel does to innocent tenses... 

She continues, [k]"This is the worst kind of paradox. It's the grandfather paradox on [i]bad acid[/i]. It doesn't make [i]any sense[/i], for like, a [i]bunch[/i] of reasons."[/k]

"I know," says Bina, and sighs. "I think that's why it's maybe going to work."

[k]"Then there's the practicality of it, even if we [i]wanted[/i] to go that far into the... wait you're agreeing with me? I'm confused now. What?"[/k]

"Here," says Bina, and hands her a crumpled piece of paper.

>>>NOTES:

[quote="Taylor Nielsen"]Just finished going through the archives, and I'm currently super sad that there isn't any more up right now. I've been enjoying this a lot. ).:

Also.. the Bina death retcon at the beginning of one of the earlier chapters still isn't fixed. And some pages with the filler text still need pics. Just a reminder in case you forgot.[/quote]

Hi Taylor! Thank you for reading! Thanks for the reminders! I am... not great about getting to the maintenance stuff I need to do for this thing.

I'm kinda torn on the Bina's Death Retcon. The last time I suggested I could remove it, people told me to leave it in, as it's an important part of the meta-story of the Adventure, but I think for archive readers it's pretty confusing.

What does everyone think? Should I just take them out?
