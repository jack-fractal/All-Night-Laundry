OK - this Bina has been ducking Gregor and his puppy for months now, [i]and[/i] she has the Moment. The living one. So she [i]should[/i] be fine. 

Amie's job here is the naughts. That's what she's here to get.

Decision made, she slips out into the hallway.

The hall continues off into darkness. She doesn't see the naughts, but after a moment, she hears another creak of timber seriously considering giving in to time and dry neglect.
