[k]"We should list all the tools we have,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"I mean, first. So we have some idea what we're aiming for. Including the ones we might be able to get from other loops."[/k]

Bina and Kendra had already gone over the basics of Bina's multiple-Bina based plan.

"Right!" says Bina, and writes that down.

[quote="smurfton"]Amie: I'm not on the same page. Why does it need killing?[/quote]

"Wait - can we back up? Why do we have to kill the botfly?" asks Amie. 

"And [i]can[/i] it be killed?" asks Emmie. "I mean - is that concept even something that applies? You are calling it a god."

"She's not a for-[i]real[/i] god," says Bina. "I think Amie was right she's just pretending. If she were [i]that[/i] cool, she wouldn't have just, like, one single confused Russian guy and his dog as her servants. It's more like a demigod, or a demon, [i]at best[/i] and [i]they[/i] get axed all the time! So what's the problem?"

"Uhhh - wait what?" says Emmie, clearly confused.

"Bina's a Hindu," says Amie, by way of explanation. "That's not the important thing though -"

"Wait - isn't the entire [i]point[/i] of Christianity that a god died? Why is this surprising to you?"

"I mean - I - I suppose you [i]could[/i] interpret it that way," says Emmie, not expecting a theological argument this early in the morning. "You would be very wrong but -"

[k]"Bina, we're getting off topic here,"[/k] says Kendra. 

"Right! What I'm saying is, I think we can take her! We have, like, a [i]lot[/i] of scary time wizardry."

"Ooohkay," says Emmie, not convinced. "I'm convinced."
