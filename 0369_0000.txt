[k]"So, [i]why[/i] did you body-check me into the mud just now?"[/k]

"Well, I didn't [i]mean[/i] to. You seemed really sad and I wanted too, I dunno, give you a hug maybe, but I stood up too fast and my legs... um... didn't."

[k]"So that was your attempt at a [i]hug[/i]."[/k]

"Yes. I'm really sorry."

[k]"Remind me you not to get you mad at me. I shudder to contemplate what you could do if you were trying to do [i]real[/i] damage."[/k]

Both of them sit in silence for a moment.

"If it's any consolation, I think my uh... previous-me's are dead too. Or something like it."

[k]"No,"[/k] Kendra sighs and adjusts the space blanket. [k]"It's not [i]that[/i]. I mean, I know we're not exactly playing for tiddlywinks here. It's just..."[/k]

She trails off.

"What? You can tell me."

[k]"It's just... you think you're special right? I mean, not you, everyone does. Like... you're watching a movie or something and you think 'If it were me. I'd get out. I'd be one of the ones got to the helicopter, or the spaceship or whatever.' and... it wasn't that I [i]died[/i] or whatever. It's that she - I died in like the worst way."[/k]

[k]"At that point, in the basement, I had no idea what was happening to me. Someone had grabbed me, and hurt me, and then she died, and she never knew why. She never knew about any of this time travel bullshit. She's not going to get to - look, it doesn't make sense when I say it out loud. OK? Just forget it."[/k]

She rubs the side of her face and flicks some of the mud away. 

[k]"I'm sorry for snapping at you."[/k]

"It's ok. I get it."

[k]"We should still go."[/k]

"Yeah, I know, but I am not looking forward to getting back into that mud."

[k]"Me neither."[/k]

[quote=tegerioreo;7592293]Bina & Kendra, if you are on a floating piece of debris, is there some way of, y'know, pushing or rowing it through the mud?[/quote]

"Maybe we could like... nah."

[k]"What?"[/k]

[img]0369_b.png[/img]

"I was thinking a raft?"

[k]"I don't see anything that would float. There's just bricks, broken machinery, and pipes. An gloom. Lotta gloom."[/k]

"I saw some barrels. I think. Over there."

[k]"Yeah, but I don't think we have [i]time[/i] to build a raft. I think the best we can do is take some of those pipes over there and use them as walking sticks. That should help with your knees."[/k]

Bina notices that Kendra doesn't mention her lingering problems with balance, but decides not to mention it.

"That's a good idea."

[k]"And it might even the playing field if we meet Mr. Shovel again. Do you know which way we should go? I mean - "[/k]

"Yes! I was thinking about that and I think we should head toward the hole."

[k]"The hole?"[/k]

"The one in the ceiling? We, uh, we can't see it from here, this big metal vat thing is in the way, but there's a hole in the roof that leads back to the construction site. "

[k]"Uh... I don't think that either of us could climb all that - [/k]

"I don't think we have too. I think someone has been exploring down here. From the construction site. There was a crane, I think they were lowering supplies and scaffolding. There might even be people there, someone must have heard the laundromat collapse, right? I think we can get out that way."

[k]"Ok. That sounds like a good enough plan to start with."[/k]

"But I... I dunno. I think we might need the piece of time."

[k]"Piece of time?"[/k]

"The thing you grabbed from the tv."

[k]"That rotten piece of wood? Eurgh. What did you want with that thing anyways? It was gross."[/k]

"You saw it as [i]wood[/i]?"

[k]"Uh... yeah? [i]weird[/i] wood. It was sort of buzzing, like it was full of flies or something."[/k]

"Uh, I think time looks like different things to different people. Anyway, I dropped it over by the tunnel entrance when you went all woozy."

[k]"I dunno Bina. We could waste a lot of time doing that. Shouldn't we just try to get to the crane?"[/k]
