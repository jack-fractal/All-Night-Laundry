[quote=Anthano]> Find shelter beneath a friendly old bus stop[/quote]

"We can do it at the bus stop!"

[color=#C10087]"We're like TEN MINUTES AWAY from the bus stop!"[/color]

"I KNOW! WALKING WAS YOUR IDEA!"

[color=#C10087]"Lets just get out of the rain then!"[/color]

"What an excellent plan!"

[quote=ArcusofBrambles;7556166]A kiss in the rain?  How romantic!

> Find an awning to take shelter under![/quote]

[color=#C10087]"Look, ok, doorway thingy! Doorway thingy!"[/color]

"Aaaaaa!"

We both run under into the shelter of a deep-set doorway.

The air changes. Out there its cold and feels a heck of a lot like being held under a waterfall. In here, inches away, it is cool and calm. 

I am excited. I love rain, especially rain like this. I can feel my pulse beating at the base of my throat. It's exhilarating and I suck in air in big greedy gulps. 

[color=#C10087]"Dang, it is really bucketing down. Sorry about this, when I heard it was going to rain I thought, you know, it was normal rain. Not this."[/color]

I am drenched. My hair clings to my neck. My dress, which is supposed to be springy and ruffled, droops. 

"Not your fault. You can't control the weather."
