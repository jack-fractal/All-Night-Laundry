[quote=CrimsonMage;7498332]>Bina: You are crossing your own history right now. You are in the next room. According to the note that is very, very bad for some reason. And even if that's not what it means, it most certainly means that if you get seen by yourself reality is probably going to break even more than it already has. Which would be really, REALLLY bad.[/quote]

OK. So going outside is super bad. 

[quote=Dregadude;7498846]>You already told her everything about Josephine right?[/quote]

"I told you about Josephine already, right?"

[k]"Uh... big french lady who owned a sugar factory? She tried to make some sort of infinite energy thing that ran on people looking at it. What it actually did is like, [i]smash time[/i]. That's all you told me."[/k]

"Yeah, that's pretty much all of it.

[quote=Zylo;7498797]> Show Kendra the note, maybe she can figure it out. Least she doesn't have a concussion.[/quote]

"Can you make any sense of this? It's the note I found in Josephine's office. I think it's from her but it doesn't make much sense to me."

Kendra takes the note. 

[k]"Hmm... you're thinking 'events are locking?'"[/k]

"Uh huh."

[k]"But we went back in time, not forward."[/k]

"I know! It doesn't make any sense. I don't even know what 'events lock' even means.  Why couldn't she have written on the BACK of the paper as well? That's twice as much space Josephine! Argh!"

[k]"Hmm"[/k]

"What?"

[k]"This last bit? That's the waveform symbol."[/k]

"What?"

[k]"The little squiggly thing shaped like a trident. It's the symbol for a quantum waveform. Like a photon or an electron orbital."[/k]

"How do you know that!?"

[k]"What? You think being a meter maid is my highest ambition?"[/k]

"Well... no."

[k]"You think I [i]like[/i] giving people tickets and having them shout at me all day?! I'm doing this to pay for school!"[/k]

"I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I retract my tone of mild surprise!"

[k]"Good. You should."[/k]
