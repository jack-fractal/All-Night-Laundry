[k]"Pretty deep."[/k]

"[i]How[/i] deep?" insist Mel, her voice getting louder. 

[k]"Mel!"[/k] says Kendra, looking around. They should be attracting attention, but the small grocers is almost empty. 

"How deep!? This is [i]dangerous[/i]."

[quote="Vincent Van Laak"]I was fated to die in that stupid Laundromat. Bina... did the impossible to save me.[/quote]

[k]"I owe Bina a lot, my life, at the very least, and [i]more[/i] then that,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"More then I can easily explain, and she is [i]stuck[/i]. No backing out, no running away. Not for her."[/k]

"And you?"

[quote = "Vincent Van Laak"]It feels like there is a lot more impossible that needs doing, and she... can't do it alone.[/quote]

[k]"I just told you, I owe her - there's a lot left to do and - well, you've seen her. What do [i]you[/i] think? What happens to her if I leave?"[/k]
