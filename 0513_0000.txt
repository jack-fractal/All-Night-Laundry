[quote=tegerioreo;7674616]Bina's journey to the rendezvous:  Be uneventful.[/quote]

It takes her about half an hour and more backtracking then she'd like to admit, but she finds her way back to the place where she's supposed to meet Kendra.

The garage is dark and quiet.

She's seen no evidence of wigglies since she exited the pipe, a fact that is beginning to seriously creep her out. 

[quote=tegerioreo;7674616]Kendra:  Be late.[/quote]

There is no sign of Kendra.

The only noises are the small liquid sounds of dripping water, and a whistle, high, distant, and intermittent, of wind through thin wires.
