OK, good idea. She's not terribly good at this but after a bit of searching - Aha! That's definitely a naught's bare foot-print. Her wriggly pals came this way -

So Piotyr came this way too. She see's nothing that looks like a boot-print, either Bina-sized or Gregor-sized, so it's possible that neither human took this path. That makes Amie uneasy. 

Gregor can't get Bina without the timeline going poof... but he can still get [i]her[/i].

[quote="12ftScarf"]+1! Wow, what a ride. Doctor Who influence notwithstanding, this is one of the most original creations I've come across. Also, you won my undying loyalty when you referenced Classic Who.[/quote]

Hi 12ftScarf! Yes! Undying loyalty. Excellent. Glad you made it to the PTP! Please tell the people in your life who like sci-fi and fantasy horror stuff!

Also please stick around and make suggestions! That would be cool.
