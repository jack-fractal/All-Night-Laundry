"OK but - I mean, what do I do?"

"You come with me, the Moment kicks everything out when it closes."

"Right but - OK, how do we find my friends?"

"Ah, that would normally be extremely difficult," says Bina.

"Why?"

"Why do you think?"

"Did I... did the Dead Moment screw something up?"

"Yes, unless they were already compensating for it, the extra entropy of the broken watch will have thrown off their trajectory pretty badly."

"How bad?" asks Amie.

"Well, I found you at 21:16 on the 17th, but... they could be practically anywhen within the Entropic well, if they made it here at all."

"Oh... crap."

Amie stares off into space for a few seconds.

"They uh... they're probably fine Amie."

"If you made it, they'll have made it too. I just hope they have the good sense to lay low..."

[quote="Anya Snow"]+1 reader, took me a little less than a week to read through, glad I clicked that advert banner ^.^

This has been a gripping story that I have been having a very hard time putting down while recovering from surgery. This work of art has made me laugh, cry, cringe and second guess the darker parts of my room. Thanks for surviving the collapse of a forum! This comic is golden and you should be very proud of it![/quote]

Hi Anya! Welcome to the PTP! I hope your recovery is going well. I am really proud of this, and thank you very much for your compliments.

[quote="Binaric Asterisk"]Wow! It took me a week and a half with schoolwork, but I finally caught up. This story is beautifully written and I loved every second of it. Your art style has for sure improved in a major way and I look forward to seeing more of this story and more from you in general. Keep up the good work! +1 reader[/quote]

Hi Binaric! Thank you very much, and I am glad you enjoyed yourself, and I hope you stick around! I'm really happy with how far I've come in terms of art while making this, especially in terms of process. Practice really helps. :)
