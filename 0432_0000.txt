[quote=xooxu;7632542]> Are there air pressure or breathing mechanics involved? Or just the suits? If there are any air filters or anything, work those out first, then go in feet first. I think the actual hazmat suit is like a jumpsuit? Zips up the front middle?[/quote]

"Isn't there supposed to be a filter thingy? I distinctly remember filter thingies from movies."

[k]"I think these ones are supposed to just work with gas-masks."[/k]

"And we..."

[k]"Have no gas-masks."[/k]

"Great."

[k]"To be fair, if breathing this stuff in was going to kill us, we'd already be dead."[/k]

"I suddenly feel SO MUCH BETTER."

[k]"I thought you might. Here, we should do this one at a time."[/k]

Several complicated minutes of fighting with zippers and duct-tape later.

"So! I think this sorta works? You think this works. I mean it's not ideal but - and you're laughing at me!"

[k]"No I'm not!"[/k]

"You totally are!"

[k]"A cough! I just coughed."[/k]

"I [i]hate[/i] being little."

[k]"It's really not that bad! You could maybe roll up the sleeves a bit."[/k]

"Har har, yeah, yuck it up.  It's your turn."

[k]"Wait, before we do my suit can you get these handcuffs off me? They're really starting to chafe and see? I found another paper-clip."[/k]
