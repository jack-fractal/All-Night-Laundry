[quote=Kytin;7589458]You can't just not tell her anything, and you are a terrible liar even when there is good reason for it. You have to tell the truth.[/quote]

"Well, uh, she said that I only got three questions, right? Like in a story. I guess it's because I was about to be drowned in garbage but, whatever. Not important. I look, I asked - I mean - I asked what she would have done differently, if she could do it again."

[k]"And?"[/k]

"She said that I'd already done it. That I'd gotten you out of the basement."

There is a long silence. 

"Before it collapsed."

Bina takes the opportunity to finish the rest of her hot chocolate.

[k]"I was going to ask why - I mean, why past-[i]me[/i] hadn't sent any notes, or medicine, or anything."[/k]

"Yeah."

[k]"'Guess we know."[/k]

"Yeah."
