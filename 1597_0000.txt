[quote="Mel Addams"]Hey! I caught up with this a few weeks ago, but forgot to come say anything. (Okay, so I was shy, and couldn't think of any commands to use as an anchor/excuse to make myself comment.) I LOVE this comic, and a bajilion kudos to you for maintaining it daily for so long. <3

I know some artists get eyetwitches when their work is compared to other things, so I'll refrain from specifics (unless you want to hear). But I will say that I have a massive mishmash-y crossover sort of thing in my brain between a lot of IPs with elements that fit together, all anchored and spurred by one in particular--and your comic fits in pretty dang well with it (which I personally find pleasing). That does somewhat color how I read your comic now and then, and I remember some crossover-links causing me to flail at pretty mundane stuff here that I imagine most other folks didn't bat an eye at. (And then part of me laughed at the rest of me, because it's hilarious.) In any case, I have my first suggestion! :D[/quote]

Hi Mel! 

Thank you for catching up, and for your enthusiasm. Your mishmash cross-over thing sounds interesting in a Tommy Westphall universe kind of way. Feel free to expound.
