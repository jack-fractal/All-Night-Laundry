"Instructions? Who from?"

[e]"My boss," says Elizabeth. "Look -" [/e]

She appears to be about to say something and instead pauses and takes a deep breath.

[e]"I am [i]handling[/i] this. OK? I have the device you left in the appartment, I have the main site locked down, I have a team looking for your 'guy with a shovel', and my bosses are sending backup. We are going to [i]stay here[/i] until that backup arrives."[/e]

[k]"Wait, a team?"[/k]

"What kind of team?" asks Bina. "Where are they?"

[e]"A [i]swat[/i] team. I sent them into the incident site."[/e]

[k]"When!?"[/k]

[e]"Like, two hours ago. They'll find your Russian guy and they'll arrest him. This is a good thing! Don't you get it? This is [i]over[/i] for you two."[/e]

"Ooh... [i]this[/i] is going to end well," says Bina in a deadpan monotone.

[k]"Are you [i]insane[/i]!? You sent them in [i]before we left[/i]!"[/k]
