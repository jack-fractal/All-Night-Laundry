"You ever wonder about this?" asks Bina, gesturing with the axe.

"What?" asks Amie. "I'm not sure wh-"

"Me neither. Not 'till now."

>>>NOTES:

Argh, ok, the link back to the start of a retcon IS a good idea, but it's also a little tricky. I'll have to modify my database a little, because right now, it's the retcon entries themselves that know which page they're dependent on, not the other way around.

Also Argh again, 'cause I completely forgot that my entirely inadequate 'About' page was still even active on the site. I thought I'd removed it a while ago. I might put danny's big block of text there, as xooxu suggests. 

[quote="Margot"]Waow! I caught up! Woo, I caught up before the end! When I started reading this I assumed it was finished for some reason, and it only occurred to me today, when I saw posts from 6 months ago, that it might still be going!

It seemed like it would be a pretty close thing whether I would catch up in time to join in, and I'm really pleased that I have! Also this means I'm gonna get to bed before midnight tonight. (I live in Scotland, so I have 15 minutes to do that)

And despite all this thinking about it, I was still surprised when I hit the 'no next button' moment. :-)

This is totally amazing, by the way, I am slightly terrified at the daily updates you've kept up for so long, and very impressed by your fantastic storytelling. Thanks![/quote]

Aah! Thank you so much for reading! 

I'm really glad you enjoyed yourself and caught up. To be honest I am slightly terrified as well. We're just about to hit four years, which is a scary amount of time to work on a single project. 

Of course, then I go look at One Piece and I feel silly, but still!
