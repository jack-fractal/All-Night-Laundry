"Are you cold?"

[k]"N-no, I'm good."[/k]

"Just so you know. Should you, at any point, utter the words 'I could maybe use some help a little' I am going to assume that you are, in fact, bleeding to death."

[k]"No r-really, I'm fine."[/k]

"Or possibly on fire."

Kendra shoots Bina a dirty look. 

"OK."

Bina stops walking and struggles out of the backpack. 

"You're wearing this now!"
