They'd asked one of the receiving nurses in Emergency and she'd told them that the 'nice young blue haired woman' who had been waiting all day had gone off with two police officers and a woman in a suit. Apparently the woman in the suit had argued with one of the site supervisors and had been given one of the spare offices in the administration wing, which is where they are now.
