It looked afternoonish when Bina looked out before, but the heavy cloud cover might have thrown that off a bit.

Hmm, yeah, maybe. 

She licks her lips with a tongue devoid of saliva.

She didn't see it in there, and she'd upended the bag over the bed. She'd feel better if she had it. 

Bina realizes that, in addition to being thirsty, she also needs to pee. 

[quote=tegerioreo;7898241]There isn't a bathroom connected to your room?  That's odd.  (Or is it?  I haven't been in a hospital in like 25 years but when I was there, a single-occupancy room like this would have a bathroom.)[/quote]

Don't hospital rooms usually have a half-bath?

She looks around.

The door is the same colour as wallpaper with a brushed steel handle. She'd seen it, but it hadn't really clicked that it was a bathroom. She'd thought it was maybe a closet or something. 

She hopes the water is still running. If it isn't she's prooobably going to freak out again.
