[quote=Chizita;7869113]Whoo, now that we've fixed the glaring continuity error, we can use the scarf to slow down Liz's injury![/quote]

[quote=xooxu;7869268]I say use the scarf if that makes most sense. Bina will understand. The entire reason she was given the scarf was to bandage her wounds.[/quote]

The scarf is... weird, but it's also the only option right now unless...

Piotyr stares at her and then barks. 

[k]"Didn't think so. Scarf it is then! Sorry Bina."[/k]

She'll understand. Probably. Maybe. If she lives.
