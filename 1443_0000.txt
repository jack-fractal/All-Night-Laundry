"I wanna see what she does with it."

"She's going to [i]kill[/i] us!" says Wong, enunciating each word.

"I don't think so," says Lia. "I mean - these other three know her, and they don't seem particularly worried. Hi! By the way, I'm Lia, nice to meet you, I think."

"Hi," says Amie, with a wave. "I'm Amie."

"Hello Lia, I'm not here," says Emmie.

[k]"I [i]am[/i] worried,"[/k] says Kendra, her voice mild and unconcerned. [k]"But I've just learned to roll with it. If she comes at you with the axe, aim for the knees."[/k]

Bina's voice floats from behind the tents, "I hear someone talking when she should be reading!"

[k]"I am reading! It's called multitasking!"[/k]

"Oh god, we're dead," says Wong.
