the office is doing that thing!!![/QUOTE]

Unfortunately, Bina is too distracted by adrenaline, fear, and rain to notice this. Things might have turned out very differently if she had.

Bina does not want Gregor sneaking up behind her. At all. 

She heads for the door, quick as she can. 

She's drenched now, right through. The rain is warm, warm as syrup, and her shoes squelch in the softening mud. This is what you get for living on an island...
