[k]"Uuurgh, my butt is entirely numb. Like, completely. I am worried we may have to amputate."[/k]

"How would you even do that? I don't think you even -can- amputate someone's butt."

[k]"It may be necessary. I cannot feel it at all."[/k]

"I am not cutting off your butt, ok? That is not happening."

[k]"That's tough but fair. Help me up then."[/k]

[quote=Everanix;7583435]> How are your legs feeling?[/quote]

Pretty crappy now that she thinks about it. 

Her knees in particular are registering strong complaints regarding the prospect of future movement.

The big problem are her hands.
