[e]"All right,"[/e] says Elizabeth, [e]"Assuming any of this is really happening and you're not just being manipulated by this creature or by the scientist woman, I still don't understand why it would destroy the sugar factory in the first place."[/e]

"Yeah," says Bina, sighing. "That's been bothering me too."
