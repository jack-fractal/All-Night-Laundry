[e]"Wait, I thought you [i]couldn't[/i] change things like that."[/e]

[k]"[i]Why[/i] would you think that?"[/k]

[e]"Because that's -"[/e]

[k]"How all the [i]stories[/i] work?" [/k]

[e]"Well no, I mean [i]yes[/i] but - look it clearly [i]didn't[/i] cause a problem so-"[/e]

[quote=xooxu]The idea is that you wouldn't act because you didn't know everything. It's shitty of us, we're aware. We're treating you like a kid because you're not prepared for what's down there. The man with the shovel is actually the least horrifying part of this.[/quote]

[k]"For [i]us[/i]!"[/k] says Kendra, throwing her hands into the air. [k]"You need to pull them out. Look, I'm - we're sorry - we should have warned you. That's on us, but, and I'm really not kidding here, you absolutely [i]do not want[/i] to send people down there. There is a [i]lot[/i] of bad stuff in that hole. Worse, [i]way[/i] worse, then one guy with a shovel! You have to call them back!"[/k]

[e]"Did you miss the part where I said they were out of communication range? You couldn't get a military satellite to transmit from down in that hole, let alone walkies, and what kind of worse? Oh god, is that... [i]thing[/i] down there? The one in the... uh... place?"[/e]

[k]"Yes. Maybe. We're... not actually sure about that one, but there are others. At least a dozen, and something else, that is very large, like a bear but bigger."[/k]

"They're talking about time travel aren't they?" says Pink Pants. 

"Noooo," says Orange Pants. 

"They're dancing all around it, trying to not actually say the [i]words[/i], but it's time travel. Right? We are watching a federal agent have a heated discussion about [i]time travel[/i]."

"Yup," says Amie.

"So it's true," says Orange Pants. "This confirms it. The lieutenant really [i]does[/i] hate me."

"Yes, he does," says Pink Pants. "[i]So much.[/i]"

"If this turns out like the furry convention, I'm moving to Ontario."

A moment later, Pink Pants has another idea. 

"On the other hand, while we are babysitting nutters - no offense Miss - 

"None taken," says Amie. 

"- We are not out in the unseasonably cold rain, standing in the middle of a malfunctioning intersection, trying to direct traffic during a city-wide brown-out, so... there's [i]that[/i]."

"Ah," says Orange Pants. "I guess that's a bit of a silver lining there yes."
