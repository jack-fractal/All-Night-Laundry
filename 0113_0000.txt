Uh, Bina says that she, uh. There was uhhh... the washing machine... 

Oh god, he's got a shovel. 

Ah, the man says, you are awake. This is good. He is just coming back from construction site after dropping off washing machine. 

He is taking the long way round so he may be checking to see if uninvited guest had any more little friends who like to be poking their noses into other peoples business.

He is going to lock door now. Ok? Is good idea.
