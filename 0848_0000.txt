[k]"So, wait, the plan now involves [i]three[/i] time machines?"[/k]

"Yup! And I think I found which ones we should use too."

[k]"But why three?"[/k]

"Well Elizabeth needs two. One to grab her and-"

[k]"- and one to nullify her momentum. Yeah, I get that part, but last time I checked, our plan only needed [i]two[/i] time machines, and now there's a third. What's the third one for?"[/k]

"Oh, that one's for [i]me[/i]."
