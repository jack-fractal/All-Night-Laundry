[quote="TechyAngel"]Ok, now REALLY check on Emmie.[/quote]

[k]"What?"[/k]

[quote="Moofius"]Kendra: *explain* (Because I don't get it *sweats*)[/quote]
[quote="Sylent-M"]I'm confused, how does the pizza relate to Gregor?[/quote]

"Do you really think I did that?"

[k]"Made me send pizza back in time? Yeah. I do. It's not something that would occur to me. I don't know what the rules are yet, but you're making things happen."[/k]

"But... I-I don't [i]glow[/i] or have zombies or - or anything. Couldn't we be wrong about -"

[k]"You saw what happened in the basement. Did any of that make sense to you?"[/k]

"I... guess?"

[k]"Well that's a problem! Real life almost never makes sense! Things don't line up neatly in real life, or they line up [i]too[/i] neatly in ways that nobody would actually believe if you wrote them down. People act erratically, yeah, but they seldom do so in ways that are cinematically interesting."[/k]

"Cinematically interesting?"

[k]"We [i]split up[/i] Amie. In a dark hospital full of monsters. We [i]split up[/i]. All six of us were OK with that!"[/k]

"Oh," breaths Amie. "Jeeze. Did I... did I get Elizabeth shot? Was that me?"
