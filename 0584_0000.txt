[quote=BreadProduct;7725097]>What are you watching?[/quote]

A line on the runway. One of the yellow ones. 

[quote=elementaryMydear;7725543]> Can you move the camera a little so we can see?[/quote]

Sure.

They've already called for people to put on their seatbelts, and the engines are going, but we haven't started to move yet.

I'm watching it because... oh it sounds stupid when I say it out loud. I'm watching it because as long as it doesn't move then it means that I can call this off. That it isn't really happening. 

Once it starts to move, that means the plane is really moving and all this is really happening and I can't stop it.

Not even if I got up and made a scene. One it starts to move, I'm stuck. I am on this plane and there's no stopping it.

So I'm watching it, and as long as I don't blink, it's not going to move, and I'm going to be able to take it all back, I can get off this plane, I can tell her I'm sorry and -

And there it goes. 

Slowly at first, then faster and faster, as the engines get louder and the wheels spin and a couple of nervous flyers a few rows ahead of me make little half-hearted wooping noises.

But it doesn't matter. It's done. I'm done. I am on this plane. 

I am doing this.

Oh that's easy enough to explain. I've just made the worst mistake of my entire life, and there's nothing I can do to take it back.

[quote=curiousTerminal;7725104]Jack, you can use Google Docs to make a survey! And it can automatically put the answers to the questions in another doc for you. I've used it a few times for school and it's pretty easy to use and pick up.[/quote]

[quote=xooxu;7725106]Google Drive has a survey thing that's completely free and has some cool options, you just need a gmail/google+ account.[/quote]

Aha! That is so convenient! Merci. I will use this.
