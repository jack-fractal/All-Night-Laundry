Behind her, the pile groans again. 

"Not pluck. Foaming!"

Wow, that one made NO sense.

Bina picks her way through the muck, trying not to trip on more submerged junk.

As she does, another long syrupy wave of mud oozes past.

>>>NOTES:

Teeny updates continue! I'm on the train again tomorrow, let's hope that the switches don't freeze again. Last time I was on this particular train, a 4.5 hour ride became an 11 hour fiasco when the entire system froze solid! Good times! (they were not good times)
