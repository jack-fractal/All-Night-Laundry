Past loops are locked in place, but the past loops can interact with the future loops

I think, my memory's gotten bit fuzzy on the exact wording of the message.[/quote]

"Wait - you," Bina cuts herself off. "That works on LOOPS, not just internally to one timeline!? You can lock [i]loops[/i] into place if you observe them?"

[k]"Errr... can we slow-down for a second?"[/k]

[k]"For the benefit of those people who are [i]not[/i] inside your head, what the heck are you two talking about?"[/k] asks Kendra.

"That piece of paper that I found in the wall!" says Bina, gesturing and miming opening a small slip of paper. "It was in the wall, way back when I first went to the factory. It said that crossing your own time-line was super dangerous. Going back was bad, but if you go [i]forward[/i] then, like, you're stuck. You can't change what happens. Dammit! I can't remember the exact wording but it was something like -"

"Do [i]not[/i] cross own history. Back bad, forward [i]worse[/i]. Events lock." says Three, from the television speakers, her tone almost a sing-song. It's clear from how she says it, that, to her, those words are familiar, worn smooth with repetition.

[k]"Oh,"[/k] says Kendra, things clicking into place, [k]"Well shit."[/k]

"Well summarized," says Three, and then, from the speakers, comes a sound like the ghost of laughter.

[k]"So, wait,"[/k] says Kendra, [k]"Doesn't that mean the second you looked into the next loop you, uhh, you kinda..."[/k] 

She trails off, not wanting to finish the thought.

Three finishes it for her. "Yes," she says, "I have doomed myself."
