[quote=ForestGardener]>We can either go one floor up and try to get that grate open, or we can try to sufficiently distract the naughts that they all follow, and then trap them. I see no reason not to attempt both if trapping them is feasible.[/quote]

[e]"OK, crap, OK,"[/e] Elizabeth whispers panicked. [e]"So, OK, we could go - ok, we could go up one floor and find the grate, right? It's a laundry chute, there should be entrances on every floor. Find the laundry room and pull the grating off - no, hold on, she might - some of us should stay here, just in case."[/e]

Elizabeth pauses for a second, thinking.

[e]"You two, wait - one of you should stay here - OK, Castillo? Come with me. Edwards, Amie, don't do anything stupid. If she falls, or they grab her, try to do something for her but don't risk your own neck."[/e]

"How the heck are we supposed to do something about all [i]that[/i] without risking our own necks?" asks Amie. 

[e]"Use your initiative!"[/e] whispers Elizabeth [e]"OK! We're going, come on Castillo."[/e]

Elizabeth casts a sharp glance at Amie, but doesn't say anything before vanishing into the inky darkness with Castillo.
