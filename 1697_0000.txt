OK - all she has to do is find Bina, find the naughts, then get the naughts to follow her.

That should be easy right? 

A stair squeaks under her foot and she tenses, but keeps climbing. She can taste something in the air, even through the filter and the mask, something hot - not spicy, but reminiscent somehow of summer. Sunlight on muddy water. Road work in July. 

She inhales the strange scent through the mask and tries not to breath heavily enough to give away her location. 

At the top of the second set of stairs she waits, listening.

After a few seconds, she hears Bina, say something, but it's too muffled by distance and intervening doors to make out.

The problem is, the voice sounded like it came from [i]above[/i] her, on the third floor or even higher.

But she'd heard the ceiling creak on the first floor, meaning they [i]can't[/i] be on the third floor. Are the naughts on the wrong floor? 

If they are, what are they doing there? 

If they are what does [i]she[/i] do?
