[k]"All right, it's... well it's hard to know where to start. There isn't an easy [i]beginning[/i] to all this, at least, not one that sounds in any way not crazy."[/k]

[e]"Start with the dog? You said she's dead. "[/e]

[quote=Chizita;7877782]You don't need to give her the whole story, start to finish; just give her the bits that concern [i]her[/i] specifically, like why she got bopped on the head, how she got here, and why she was saved.[/quote]

[quote=badatnamesbluhbluh;7877846]>Start with what's most relatable: How you got into this by getting kidnapped by a russian guy.[/quote]

[k]"That... might work, but I think Bina would be the better person to tell you about the fluffball here. She told me some of it, but I don't have all the details. Lets start with her master instead, Gregor."[/k]

[e]"Gregor Petrovich?"[/e]

[k]"I [i]think[/i] that's his name. Yeah. He's the reason I'm here, and he's the reason you're here too."[/k]

[e]"He works in the laundromat. [i]That[/i] laundromat... which... wait - how - why is that still standing?"[/e]

[k]"Time travel."[/k]

[e]"You're joking."[/e]

[k]"I am not, in fact, joking."[/k]

[e]"But that doesn't - how -"[/e]

[k]"Lets not get side tracked, OK? Otherwise we're not going to get anywhere. Let's stay with Gregor, at least for the moment."[/k]

[e]"I had him down as a probable casualty of the subsidence."[/e]

[k]"Subsidence?"[/k]

[e]"The building falling down. That building. The one that is still standing up. He lived up there - [i]lives[/i] up there - with his uncle."[/e]

[k]"Well he's not dead. He's very much alive. In fact, he's been walking around abducting people by hitting them with a shovel."[/k]

[e]"People? Like, multiple people?"[/e]

[k]"Mmhmm."[/k]

[e]"How many?"[/e]

Kendra has to think about that for a few minutes. 

[k]"Eight? Nine maybe? Nine, if you count Bina. Though in all three of our cases he didn't actually manage the abduction thing properly. I don't actually know about the cops either, he may have just killed them."[/k]

[e]"Cops?"[/e]

[k]"He mentioned that some police showed up to investigate the site of the 'subsidence'. He got them too."[/k]

[e]"This is probably a dumb question, but do you have any proof of any of this or any idea [i]why[/i] he's doing it? I heard he got into a fight with some of the construction guys when his dog died, but what possible reason - I mean, why kidnap [i]nine[/i] people? I've heard of spree killings before, but not spree... whatever-this-is."[/e]

[k]"Well... he thinks he's working for an angel."[/k]
