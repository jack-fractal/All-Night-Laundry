>>>NOTES:

OK! Retcon has begun with this update. Err... Bina is currently having a seizure so... suggestions probably won't be a thing for the next update or two.

I am not doing as well as I'd like on interactivity. My apologies for that. I really do love taking suggestions, but I've sort of written myself into a corner here and its going to take a few days to get us out of that corner and back to somewhere where interactivity makes sense.

I appreciate your continued patience. 

Also! I basically gave up on adding the links to the updates a while ago, something I've been meaning to get back too... so I'll be trying to work my way through the archive to get those up to date.
