[quote=Lacemaker;7509886]Great, does Kendra have the weird brain-talky thing now? Is her Wernicke's/Broca's area on the fritz like Bina's was?[/quote]

"Craaaap," says Bina. "Did you mean to say 'hamper'? 'Cause if you didn't, I think you might have the talky brain thing I had. It's ok though, it should be tempo -

Kendra lets out a coughing sound that might be a laugh, then winces and clutches her head. [k]"No."[/k]

"What?"

[k]"I don't have 'your talky brain thing',"[/k] her voice is raspy and faint, [k]"I meant to say hamper. It's what we missed."[/k]

"Uh." Bina isn't sure what she's talking about.

[k]"The [i]laundry[/i] hamper. In the office. I opened it when we were looking for the clock, but it was empty. It should have been closed. I..."[/k] she trails off, distracted, [k]"God, I am so cold. Where are we?"[/k]

"We're in the sugar factory."

[k]"What? We went back in time again? When did - "[/k]

"No. No, I mean the remains of the sugar factory. It's buried in the construction site behind the laundromat - err - behind where the laundromat used to be. I didn't get to tell you before, uh..."

[k]"Really?"[/k]

"Yep."

[k]"[i]Behind[/i] the laundromat?"[/k]

"Uh huh."

[k]"I'm not really thinking too clearly right now, but, that does not make any sense, at all, does it?"[/k]

"Nope," says Bina, "Not one bit."

[k]"Oh good. We'll just, you know,"[/k] she waves a hand in the air as though drawing a line on a chalkboard, [k]"Add that one to the list."[/k]

"Will do."

There is a long pause.

[k]"This is a long shot I know, but just to be sure, we're not, currently, spinning around really fast, are we? Like on a theme-park ride?"[/k]

"Uh, no. We're lying on the ground, not moving at all. We're more," she yawns, "We're more sort of freezing to death, I think." 

Bina is aware that she should feel more worried about this, but it's hard to feel much of anything right now. It doesn't even feel that cold anymore. 

[k]"Oh,"[/k] says Kendra, then, after a few seconds, as though after great deliberation, [k]"That really sucks."[/k]
