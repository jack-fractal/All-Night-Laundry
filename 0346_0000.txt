I RUN THROUGH HIS LEGS AND OUT INTO THE OTHER PLACE!

"Oh no! Piotyr! Again!? This is third time today!"

The other place is GREAT! It has walls, and a sky, and piles and piles of interesting things, but I don't stop and smell them, I just RUN!

RUN RUN RUN!

"Ugh! Dyadya, I am going after dog again."

"Again?!"

That is old-man-who-smells-like-mints-and-poop. I do not like him. He puts me in the tiny room and NEVER plays the game with me.

"Yes. Again."

"Why are you not putting her in closet like I am telling you to do?"

"Because she does not [i]like[/i] the putting in closet dyadya!"

"Uuurgh. Fine. Go after her."

"Yes dyadya."

"And make sure she does not get down into building place again or they will be making more of the complaints!"

"Ya ya."

Hurray! Hurray!

Yes, I'm getting that too, started happening recently, within the last few days.
