"Hey! You can't be here. This is private property, and like, an active crime scene, a subsidence risk, and about ten other things that say you can't be here."

"Dude!" hisses Lia. "What are you doing!? These are [i]them[/i]."

"Them who?" asks Wong, very confused, and getting annoyed at this whole situation.

"[i]Them[/i] them!" says Lia, flailing a bit. "The people Liz told us about! The people the scary lady on the phone was talking about? The uh... the [i]time travellers[/i]?"

Everyone come close... please. No, a little closer. Yes, there good.

Look... We have to finish this story. I know you like making friends but we can't... we can't just keep picking up all these characters. 

At first it's all fun and games but then they need plotlines, and backstories, and angst... we just gotta keep moving.
