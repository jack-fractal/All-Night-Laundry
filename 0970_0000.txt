[quote=curiousFellow;7884438]>So what if you call for backup? If you even manage to convince people to help you, you're trying to get information about the botfly out of Gregor, and any cavalry you call in can't safely find out about him. You don't think proffesionals are going to just let you deliberately keep them in the dark, are you?[/quote]

Hmm... that's a good point.

[k]"So hey, Elizabeth, just as a hypothetical, if you [i]did[/i] call the cops and they [i]did[/i] catch Gregor, what would happen?"[/k]

[img]0970_a.png[/img]

[e]"He'd... get arrested? That's usually what happens when you attack federal officials with shovels and then get caught by the cops. What did you think would happen? Nobody's going to be throwing him any parades."[/e]

Ah, they're back to [i]this[/i] kind of conversation. Goodie.

Kendra tries again, [k]"Right - I get that - but what then? I mean, after he's arrested, he'd get interviewed right? Would you be the one to interview him?"[/k]

[e]"Probably not."[/e]

[k]"I asked that wrong, [i]could[/i] you be the one to interview him? Is that within your authority as a whateveryouare?"[/k]

[e]"I guess. If he's involved in, or interfering with, my investigation then yes, but it's not something I normally do."[/e]

[k]"Why not?"[/k]

[e]"Because I'm not a trained interrogator, and unlike what TV would have you believe, interrogations are hard work and are easy to screw up. That, and because pulling rank on local cops without a damned good reason is an excellent way to get a whole stinking load of unofficial non-cooperation."[/e]

[k]"Ah."[/k]

[e]"What do you care anyway?"[/e]

[k]"How... fast could that happen? I mean, if you caught him. Could you interview him [i]today[/i], or is there like processing time and stuff?"[/k]

[e]"Uhh... I think I'm going to need to know where you're going with this before I answer any more questions."[/e]
