[quote=ICan'tGiveCredit;7386516]> Bina: Finish your message before the wind gets to you again. Reality is noticing you making changes to an otherwise NORMAL painting![/quote]

Looks like it! The wind picks up, faster then before. Buffeting into her, throwing her hair into her face.

[quote=Beastnix;7386544]>Best to make that message shorter[/quote]

OK? Yeah! It feels like that whatever force it is that makes this wind isn't messing about this time. 

Shorter message.

Bina quickly scrawls the first thing that comes into her mind into the painting. Bina had worried that the canvas would be tough, the paint needing to be scratched many times to take a mark, but that is not the case here. The canvas is brittle. Bina cuts right through it in several places.
