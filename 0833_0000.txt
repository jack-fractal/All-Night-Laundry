"Do you think this thing is going to be tall enough?"

[k]"Yes."[/k]

"And you don't think she'll get whiplash from gravity changing on her all at once?"

[quote=Fuade;7846815]Actually, thinking more about it, I don't think whiplash would be a big factor.  Since the velocity change would happen all at once, as opposed to Portal where the legs would hit the new gravity before the rest of the body, I don't think she'll be whipped around all that much.  She'd just go from accelerating to decelerating.  So she'd probably experience some discomfort, but it shouldn't do a lot of overall harm.[/quote]

[k]"No more than you get when you jump up and down. Gravity is constant, we're not affecting her velocity at all, just her [i]acceleration[/i]. She'll pull exactly two G's, and that's only for an instant. A baby can take two G's."[/k]

"All right but what if-"

[k]"She's going to be [i]fine[/i] Bina! Stop worrying!"[/k]

"But are you [i]sure[/i] this is going to work? We only get one shot at this."

[k]"Hey! This was [i]your[/i] plan, remember?!"[/k]

"Yeah, but - I mean..." she trails off. "This is pretty nuts, right?"

"Sure. Here you go."

[k]"Thanks,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"Anyway yeah, it's pretty nuts."[/k]

>>>NOTES:

I have to do another retcon people. A real metatextual one, not an in-fiction one. 

I did not anticipate this variation on the plan at all (it is a [i]very[/i] clever plan, well done Fuade, my hat is off to you) so I need to make a small change to update [post]821[/post]. That's the one where Kendra says that "Elizabeth" is late. I'm changing that to [i]Bina[/i] being late, as that makes more sense with the new plan. Aside from that, everything else stays the same. 

I also want to say thanks for everyone for sticking with me through this weird non-linear section. I wanted to try something like this as an experiment and it's... been interesting.
