[quote="tinwatchman"]> Kendra: Relent. Okay, not the greatest thing ever, but it was good thinking in a pinch. After all, you could've had two people with injured feet rather than one otherwise.[/quote]

[k]"All right,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"Sorry. However we get them, shoes are important. You did the right thing Amie, otherwise you could be sitting here with cut-up feet as well. Getting Bina some footware is job number one."[/k]

"What did you even step on Bina?" asks Amie.

"Oh!" says Bina, remembering. "This."

She pulls out the offending object.

[k]"Holy crap,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"Is that - ?"[/k]

"Evil undead time dog tooth?" suggests Bina. "Yes, that is precisely what this is."

"Something hurt her?" asks Amie. "I thought she was invincible."

"Me too," says Bina. 

[k]"Hmm,"[/k] hums Kendra, pursing her lips and staring at the tooth.

"What?"

[k]"Well - if I had to guess, I don't think it was the cops down in the tunnel who did that."[/k]
