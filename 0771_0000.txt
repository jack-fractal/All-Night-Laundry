[quote=rachelcp;7818559]But what about the trees?[/quote]

[k]"OK, so, I mean. That's a cool idea, and it might even be true, but I don't get how it relates to the trees or any of the other stuff."[/k]

"It doesn't. I mean, not directly."

[quote=grimalkinInferno;7819145]>okay, that's intersting, but what does this have to do with the story proper?[/quote]

[k]"All right. Bina what does any of this have to do with you not wanting to read your own journals and notebooks?"[/k]

"I [i]do[/i] want to read them! Really bad! They're [i]years[/i] of my life that I don't remember. Don't you think I'd want to read that?"

[k]"Then why don't you? We have [i]extensive[/i] evidence by this point that you are more than just â€˜good' at this whole time travel thing, and if we can't fix the viewers then we are going to have to jump blind. That means we could end up anywhere and anywhen in the whole entropic well we're in."[/k]

"Entropic well?"

[k]"You'd know what that was if you had [i]read the notebooks[/i]."[/k]

"But - Eurgh. I don't even know if avoiding them is even helping."

[k]"Helping what? I'm honestly not following you Bina. You had a cool idea two nights ago. OK. So what? What happened next?"[/k]

"You should know. It just happened to you."

[k]"What are you talking about?"[/k]

"When you figured it out. Just now. I was watching. You smiled. How did you feel?"

[k]"Feel? I don't know. Happy? Interested maybe?"[/k]

"Smart. You felt smart. Clever. You'd just [i]figured something out[/i]."

"Which is exactly how I felt two nights ago."

"Which is [i]exactly[/i] how Josephine must have felt."

[quote=serpentineInterloper;7818722]And that's beautiful, and your brain is also beautiful, jack-fractal.[/quote]

Thank you. That's very nice of you to say. 

[quote=wolftamer9;7819067]Yeah but if you contact a mod they'll move it to the main forum.[/quote]

I did that, but it looks like Professor Lizard hasn't checked his PM's yet. If we're still cradle-bound in a day or so I'll post in the usual cradle release thread.
