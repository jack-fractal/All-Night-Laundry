OK, so this has somethign to do with the perception stuff. Maybe it's - no, no time! Just don't think about it.

Aaaaargh!

Think about something else! Think about Elizabeth! She's heavy, and damn I wish I'd gotten some gauze on her before well - head wounds bleed pretty bad, but this...

God, she just, she didn't even [i]throw[/i] it! It just -

Why is it always pink elephants? Isn't that, like, cheating, using something that everyone's already thought about when trying to make people not think about something?

Woah... this is cool!
