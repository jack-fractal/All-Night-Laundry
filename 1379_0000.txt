"I think so," says Bina. "I mean, do you want to keep going Amie?"

[quote="tegerioreo"]Pff, you can't start a crazy wall and not finish it. That's just not done.[/quote]

"Hmm? Oh! Yeah. Totally. Look, without all the gaps filled in we can't really know a lot of stuff for sure. Like, right now, it looks like confronting Team Green directly is what leads to a loop, but I could be totally wrong about that."

"Yeah... it's going to be hard to figure that one out because the journals just [i]end[/i]."

[k]"All right,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"So, let's keep going then."[/k]

"You're going to help?" asks Amie. 

[k]"I'm not having any luck with the danged time machine today. Maybe tomorrow morning me and Bina can put our heads together and get it working, but I'm done for now."[/k]

"OK! Uh... thanks." says Bina.  

[k]"So... how do we do this? The wall thing."[/k]

"Well Bina's been reading the journals," says Amie. "Then I write them down and stick them on the wall?"

[k]"So, which one of you needs help?"[/k]

"I guess Bina?" says Amie. "Even with moving stuff around on the wall to make room I'm usually the one waiting."

"I'm going as fast as I can!" says Bina. "It's hard to figure out how to format them. I wasn't really writing with 'individual events that fit on a sticky note' in mind."

[k]"That works for me,"[/k] says Kendra, [k]"I've read most of these."[/k]

[k]"Sooo..."[/k]

[k]"Just to be clear - do we have a special [i]syntax[/i] or something for recording Bina's weird sex fantasies or -"[/k]
