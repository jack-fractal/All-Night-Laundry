[quote="xooxu"]Wait? The Hound went down the tracks? Like down past all those people? And no one noticed?

And now your have to go down past those people? Cuz I very much doubt that is going to work as is. Someone would notice. Someone has to notice three women walking down on the tracks right in front of them, two of which are in their PJs. They'd stop you. Try to call the cops, maybe even forcibly grab you and try to remove you from the tracks, especially if there are any officials there.[/quote]

"Look, I don't think this is going to work," says Amie. "I mean, [i]someone[/i] has to notice, right? I mean - they have too! We could just climb [i]around[/i] maybe and -"

[quote="tinwatchman"]> Kendra: Which way does the blood trail lead? Does it go away or towards the platform?[/quote]

[k]"The blood goes this way Amie, not that way,"[/k] says Kendra, pointing. [k]"Into the tunnel. Come on."[/k]

"Oooh!" says Amie, scrabbling after them. "Right!"

"I wonder what would happen if I touched the third rail with my spooky arm," says Bina, kind of out of nowhere.

[k]"Bina,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"No."[/k]

"I'm not being [i]serious[/i]..."

[k]"It would be a spectacularly bad move,"[/k] continues Kendra. [k]"Not only would it kill you, which it would, [i]definitely[/i]. It might also kill [i]everyone[/i]. Not everyone nearby, I mean, everyone [i]period.[/i]"[/k]

"All right, I'm not going to [i]try it[/i], jeeze."
