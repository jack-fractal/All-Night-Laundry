"I don't have it!" says Bina.

[quote="Ayla"]Bina: Inform them that 'Agent Miller' is currently unconscious due to surgery for a bullet wound. She was unable to give you a secret code word.[/quote]

"She's unconscious! She didn't mean for me to call you or anything. I only got into this phone because of doing some really sketchy stuff with causality! I don't -"

"Then I'm afraid we can't help you," says the voice on the phone. It sounds tired.

"Wait!"

[quote="Kree"]Oh dear. Ask for context, perhaps? Maybe you didn't know it was a code word?[/quote]

"Maybe she told me and I don't know. You can't give me a hint?!"

The voice is silent.

"OK," she thinks. "OK, OK, OK... I'll get it. Umm..."

[quote="Chaz Wallace"]What grows in the corpse of a day?[/quote]

Words scrawled in running black letters...

"What grows in the corpse of a day?"

There is a pause.

"Botfly! Giant bug from space!"

"No, this isn't-"

[quote="Magic hobo"]Bina: The codeword is Mulder![/quote]
[quote="Fro_52"]Okay... Sorry for this, but no one else has said it yet..... "Swordfish"[/quote]

"Banana! Mulder! Swordfish!"

There is silence, and hope, and then it dies.

"This is a secure line. Interfering with an ongoing investigation is a-"

She has nothing. Why wouldn't Elizabeth tell her? Why wouldn't [i]Kendra[/i] tell her? She sent a note from the future and she couldn't take the time to - and then a memory, like a bolt of lightning from a clear blue sky. 

It had been dark and cold and Kendra had gone back to get a map -

- she'd gone back and she had grabbed papers in the dark, randomly, she'd gotten the map but also autopsies and dissection records, information about the investigation -

- and with those papers, a folder, and on that folder - 

[quote="Chaz Wallace"]Celadon Jungle[/quote]

"Celadon Jungle!" says Bina. "Celadon Jungle, that's the code word. Celadon Jungle."

There is silence, then a click.

"Thank you. Transferring you now."
