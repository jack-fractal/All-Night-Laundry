[quote=xooxu;7568758]>Are we going to keep running?[/quote]

"No. It's not helping. She just keeps catching up with me."

[quote=AweshumeT;7568578]Do the Dream thing. Stand bravely to this feat, and stomp it to the ground. Not literally,  of course. He's too big for your feet.[/quote]

[color=#C10087]"Are you going to fight her? This is your dream. You might be able to take her. That's what people do in this situation right? You face your fear! You step up! This is where I-we-you fight her."[/color]

[quote=tegerioreo;7569058]Face your fear.[/quote]

"No it isn't! Besides I'm not even really that frightened of her."

[color=#C10087]"Lies!"[/color]

"I'm not lying!"

[color=#C10087]"You totally are! You are a lying liar who lies."[/color]

"Well yeah, of course I'm afraid of her! She's a giant skeletal dog-thing that's the size of a truck! What I mean is - I mean - I just meant that she doesn't [i]mean[/i] anything to me. Like, personally. She's in my dreams, but she's not MY dream. She's a monster, but she's not [i]my[/i] monster. If you get what I'm saying."

[color=#C10087]"I do not."[/color]

"I've never been traumatized by a dog! I've never even owned one, not until Piotyr and I'm pretty sure I don't actually OWN Piotyr. She just sort of decided that she'd hang around in my head. I've never been chased by a dog down a dark alley, until like, five mintues ago. I'm not afraid of them! They aren't important to me. I'm more of a cat person, really. This isn't [i]about[/i] me."

[color=#C10087]"Uhhh..."[/color]

"This isn't the moment when I face my fear and realise that the power was within me all along. I'm not the kind of person that sort of thing happens too! I've never even been in a fist fight. I'm a waitress!"

[color=#C10087]"You're more than a waitress."[/color]

"EVERY waitress is more than a waitress."

[color=#C10087]"Well [i]yeah[/i]! That's what I'm saying!"[/color]

"Look - if I tried to fight her, I'm pretty sure I'd just go kersplut. Besides, even if I won, Debbie has a nasty habit of not staying dead."

[color=#C10087]"Then what are you going to do about her?"[/color]

"I don't know! I don't know enough about her, or how she relates to Piotyr! Heck, I don't know enough about Piotyr either! She's [i]Gregor's[/i] dog, or she was. What happened to her? How did she get into the sugar factory? Is she even alive? How did she get into my dreams!?"

[color=#C10087]"Oh look, that would be Debbie."[/color]

"Of course it is. That's just [i]great[/i]."

[color=#C10087]"I think she looks a mite tetchy, don't you?"[/color]

"Aaaargh!"

[color=#C10087]"Well you [i]do[/i] keep getting away from her. It's got to be getting annoying."[/color]

"But she keeps [i]finding[/i] me."

[color=#C10087]"So go somewhere else!"[/color]

"Yeah, ok, sure, good plan, but - uh - NEWSFLASH! I'm [i]dreaming[/i]. I'm [i]stuck[/i] in my own head!"

[color=#C10087]"Really? Are you sure about that?"[/color]
