[quote=Mangulwort;7439564]What does the line about the maggot and the day mean?[/quote]

Right!

And why does it keep doing that? Whenever I think about it, it goes all funny in my head.

[i]"Uhhh...."[/i]

Come on! I think I'm starting to be able to feel my knees, and they're not happy with me. I think I'm waking up! Hurry!

[i]"Sorry, it's just, I don't know what that is."[/i]

What do you mean you don't know? Didn't you write it?

[i]"No! I've never seen that before. Is that's the door to Josephine's office?"[/i]

Yes.

[i]"But where did the writing come from?"[/i]

I don't know! That's why I'm asking you!

[i]"It's a damaged memory, like when we go through a crack and change something, but there shouldn't BE a crack there. There hasn't been one before. It must be new, or unique to your loop? I don't know. I don't know! I'm sorry."[/i]

Well great! That's just bloody fantastic!
