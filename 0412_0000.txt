There are a LOT of gas-mask filters. Like, six boxes, and there's a few empty boxes too. They seem to be pretty serious about the gas-mask thing.

No gas-masks though, at least on these shelves. Just the filters.

Well they already have a bottle of spray cleaner from B12's backpack. 

... but still. She can't leave without taking something.

She has to jump to grab a pack of wet wipes from the top shelf, and only then realizes that she doesn't have anything to store her loot in. The backpack is still outside.

So... that happened.
