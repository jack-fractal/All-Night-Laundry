[quote="jmcallaway"]Actually, the letter can't be completely all doom-an-gloom. I don't think Amie is THAT good an actress--her handling of the Naughts was more like inspired Warner Bros desperation (worked all the time for B.B. after all)--and she didn't look horribly flustered when she came 'round the corner. Confused, maybe, but not like "I know what's going to happen to Ned Stark." kind of upset.[/quote]

"Is it bad?" asks Bina. 

"Nah!" says Amie. "I dunno what it's [i]for[/i] yet, but it's not bad."

[k]"Why can't we read it?"[/k] asks Kendra.

"Errr..." says Amie, looking like she doesn't want to answer. "It's not [i]both[/i] of you..."

[k]"It's just me?"[/k] asks Kendra, frowning. [k]"Why can't [i]I[/i] read it?"[/k]

[quote="Wolph Strykes"]Oooh thought! Let the note BE from Kendra![/quote]

"'Cause it's [i]from[/i] you." suggests Amie. "It's signed 'Kendra' and future-you says not to show past-you or bad stuff will happen."

[k]"Why would I write something I'm not allowed to read?"[/k]

[quote="Tyler Shelton"]Aaaaaaaaannnnnnd.....done! Caught up. Phew. Now the only question is, what time of day do I need to be checking this thing if I want in on making suggestions?[/quote]

Hi Tyler! Xooxu is absolutely correct

[quote="xooxu"]Zach normally updates in the middle of the night on the east coast. Usually comments made before midnight get used, so you can check anytime, really.[/quote]

Suggestions from pretty much any time of day can and will get used.

Thank you for reading and I'm glad you caught up! :)
