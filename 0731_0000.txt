[quote=a52;7798699]I wasn't joking, but I wasn't being literal and I exaggerated a little bit. But it's all cool, I like a good scare once in a while. (It also may not have helped that I read that in the middle of the night.)[/quote]

Ah, ok... Thanks!

I can never get a handle on how scary my adventure is. People keep calling it horror and... I guess I see that, sorta, but to me it's like... just this thing I do. Then I remember the enormous undead dog, and all the claustrophobia, hypothermia, and drowning stuff and I realize that my experience of this thing, and everyone [i]else's[/i] experience with this thing are probably very different.
