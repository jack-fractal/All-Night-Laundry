She looks like she needs it. 

[quote=a52;7719244]>Bina: Activate BEAR powers (aka fall asleep)[/quote]

She also looks like she's falling asleep.

[k]"Bina?"[/k]

No response.

[k]"Bina!"[/k]

"Mmmmh?"

[k]"You can't go to sleep. We can't stay here."[/k]

"Mmmh."

[k]"I'm going to pick you up, ok? Are you hurt?"[/k]

"Mmmhmm."

[k]"Where?"[/k]

[i]That[/i] gets a smile.

"[i]Everywhere?[/i]"

[k]"Bina, that's not particularly helpful."[/k]

"Mostly my chest. I think my ribs are broken."

[k]"How did - [/k]

"A door fell on me."

[k]"A door fell on you. OK, no, don't explain. How many of your ribs are broken?"[/k]

"Uhhh...."

[k]"Don't say 'All of them'."[/k]

"[i]Most[/i] of them?"

[k]"All riiight. Ok. Well, we're gonna just go really slow? Here, I'm going to get you now. Tell me if it hurts."[/k]

"OK. It's ok. Aaah. I [i]can[/i] walk, you know?" This sentence comes out a bit mushy.

[k]"You absolutely [i]cannot[/i]. Can you hold onto my neck?"[/k]

"Uh huh."

[k]"OK, here we go."[/k]

[k]"I won't drop you."[/k]

"OK."
