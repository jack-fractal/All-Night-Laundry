[quote="powerfulPlutonium"]>Kendra: Try to articulate that there is pizza coming. It might be bad for him to know, it would be worse for him to be surprised at seeing the pizza guy and shoot him.[/quote]

[k]"Heyyyy!"[/k] says Kendra, deciding that if she's going to do this thing, she might as well go all in and has decided to attempt to project the kind of positive attitude she's never been very good at. [k]"You hungry?"[/k]

"What?" asks Gregor, he sounds confused and surprised.

[k]"Well! I was hungry, so I order pizza!"[/k]

"You ordered pizza."

[k]"Yeah! I'll share!"[/k]

"You... are here to eat pizza?"

[k]"Yeah! Delivery, in a few minutes!"[/k]

"You [i]are[/i] time travelling... for pizza?"

[k]"Yep!"[/k]
