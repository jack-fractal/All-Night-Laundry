[quote=Lacemaker;7684831]Now comes the time where Bina and Kendra must decide. Are they in real life, where the authorities must be contacted, or are they in a story, in which plot must happen?[/quote]

[k]"Bina, we're not equipped for this."[/k]

"I know! But - 

[k]"I mean, Bina, there are people who - and man, I cannot believe that [i]I[/i] am the one arguing to leave this to the cops but [i]this[/i] - but there are people whose job it is to deal with this kind of crap. [i]We[/i] need to get out of here."[/k]

"Stop saying my name like that!"

[k]"What?"[/k]

"Like I'm some stupid [i]child[/i] who doesn't know what she's talking about! I [i]know[/i] we're not equipped for this. I know! But this is [i]happening[/i]! This is for [i]real[/i]. We're not [i]playing[/i] here. We're not [i]pretending[/i]. There are actual for-real [i]monsters[/i] and you've [i]seen[/i] them and what makes you think that the cops or the army or whatever has [i]any way[/i] of dealing with them?"

[k]"Because that's what they do!"[/k]

And they're both on their feet again, and Bina can't quite remember when that happened.

"Aaargh! You know what I mean! This is back-from-the-dead [i]time zombies[/i]! And a dog that is somehow [i]two dogs[/i] and also maybe a [i]dream[/i]. It's not just some person with a gun or whatever. This is honest to badness [i]monsters[/i]! Can't you just trust me?" 

[k]"I [i]want[/i] too, but - [/k]

"I know I'm right about this. I [i]know[/i] I'd hid it in the lab. I know it down to my bones. If I can't trust [i]myself[/i] I - I've done this thirteen times already Kendra. Please."

[k]"But,"[/k] says Kendra, in the tone of someone disarming a bomb, [k]"Maybe the reason you've done this thirteen times is because you make the wrong decision here. This decision. Right now?"[/k]

[quote=xooxu;7684886]Also, psst, you put "Jully" on that map. Also, Celedon Jungle is an extremely awesome name for shady government people to give this place.[/quote]

Aaargh. I was thinking 'juillet'. Thank you. *fixes that*

[quote=Redsoff;7684955]Also is it supposed to be celedon or celadon?[/quote]

It's supposed to be with an A! Aaargh. Thank you! *fixes [i]that[/i]*
