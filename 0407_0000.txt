"I think we still need the diary!"

[quote=Sporothrix;7617631]> Bina: go look for spare clothes/towels while Kendra showers, basically anything that'd allow her to dry herself instead of walking around dripping wet and getting hypothermia in this time-cracked cold you're both in.[/quote]

"So I'm goinna go look in this tent here, now, ok? We need a flashlight, and maybe a towel or something and -

[k]"Bina, we have to get this stuff off of us."[/k]

[quote=Fuade;7616177]I still say you should find some clean clothes first.  If the mud is full of Time Cancer then you don't want to be wearing clothes soaked in the stuff[/quote]

"Besides, we don't want to put on our dirty clothes right? It's be counterproductive, putting on dirty clothes, right? After getting clean. I mean, that would kind of not make sense, right? Especially if they're full of uranium or TIME CANCER or something - "

[k]"Time cancer?"[/k]

"Or something! I mean. Yeah. Maybe there's suits in here, there, the tent I mean. This one, right here. The suits they mentioned. On the whiteboard. That would be good, right? OK! Getting the suits now, bye!"

[k]"Bina! Come back! You're probably covered in toxic waste!" [/k]
