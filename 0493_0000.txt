She knows! Aaah!

[quote=tronn;7664322]Did the thing stretch to grew bigger? Or did it do that unfolding thing? Where the extra mass seems to be coming? Take notes, Kendra![/quote]

It just. 

It just like...

It [i]opened[/i] and then there was more of it. Things, sliding where there should have been no sliding. 

It had shuddered, opened, and then... and then a wave of meat.

And a stink. Not organic, as would make sense, or even [i]wet[/i], though it's interior glistened, slick and oily.

A hot smell. 

Dry. 

Metallic.

There are three torso's now. 

It sort of... ate her pipe.

 It's stuck in the side there. Half way up (down?) the second rib-cage.

[quote=tegerioreo;7664317]UH.  That went wrong.  Probably no point in trying to apologize.  Switch immediately to option 2:  FLEE.  With great alacrity![/quote]

She needs to get this thing away from the tent entrance, 'cause she is [i]not[/i] leaving without those maps. She hopes that the extra weight will slow it down.
