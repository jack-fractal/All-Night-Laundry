[quote="BookNerd"]Tigers don't talk, or try to talk to YOU. The fact that it attempted to communicate indicates it understands (or at least thinks) that YOU can understand IT.[/quote]

"She's not a tiger!" says Amie, trying one last time. "She tried to communicate with you-"

"She didn't."

"But - you just said-"

"I said she [i]talked[/i] to me, she wasn't trying to communicate."

"Oh my god!" says Amie. "You can't just -"

"Perhaps we could take it down a notch?" suggests Emmie.

"Just a little. I mean - we're all on the same team here."

Bina realizes that she's been raising her voice. She tries again, aiming for calm and almost making it, "Right, I know it sounds like I'm splitting hairs, but, Amie, she wasn't trying to [i]convince[/i] me or to understand me. She tried to [i]manipulate[/i] me, and then got stroppy when it didn't work."

[quote="Robin Alquist"]This. Wild animals aren't intelligent. The Botfly clearly is. You're not locked in a box with a tiger, you're locked in a box with a 5 year old waving a shotgun around like a toy.[/quote]

"But she [i]can[/i] talk," says Amie. "She talks to Gregor! She's not a mindless animal, she's more like, I dunno, like a kid with a shotgun. We have to give her a [i]chance[/i]!"
