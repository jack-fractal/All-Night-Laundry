They had ended up going with cardboard boxes underneath foam mattresses. The idea being that the mattresses might fold in around her when she hit them. Kendra had assured Bina that just cardboard boxes would be fine, but Bina had insisted on adding the mattresses, for the look of the thing.

Bina had expected it to take hours to fold all those boxes, but they had done it in just twenty minutes.

"It's fine! Besides, it won't matter. I'll be back in loads of time."
