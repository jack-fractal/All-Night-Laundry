[quote=Dregadude;7589736]>FRIEND HUG THIS INSTANT

[size=10]OR UH ACQUAINTANCE HUG OR SURVIVOR HUG IF YOU'RE NOT QUITE READY FOR A FRIEND HUG[/size][/quote]

[quote=Lacemaker;7589762]Seconded. Do the casual, "I'm totally just leaning on you because I'm cold and for absolutely no other reason." side-hug. Kendra needs to brood for a moment, and the best thing you can do is physically reassure her that you're there for her while simultaneously giving her the mental space to process this. Don't break the silence unless Kendra breaks it first or it becomes obvious you've tarried too long. (Measured in terms of empty wrappers and lack of hot chocolate, of course.) It'll be better for Kendra in the long run if you give her the space to come to terms with it now.[/quote]

Bina tries to go for the sideways friend-hug but -

"Kendra, are you - 

[k]"Look. Lets make a deal all right? I won't ask you if you're ok, if you don't ask if I'm ok."[/k]

[k]"OK?"[/k]
