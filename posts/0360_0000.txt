It's not nothing! 

[quote="wolftamer9"]> What is it, a note? Check it out.[/quote]

"It's a note!"

[k]"Why is it in a ziplock bag?"[/k]

"Because it's really wet down here and she didn't want it to turn into goo?"

[k]"Ah, low-cost lamination. Clever."[/k]

"Thank you."

[k]"Does the clever thing count if it wasn't the current version of you who did the clever thing?"[/k]

"Yes," said Bina, unfolding the note, "Yes it does."

[quote="xooxu"]>Note: be confusing and useless until later, when we figure something out and it all makes sense.[/quote]

[k]"B12? Bina 12? You [i]numbered[/i] yourself?"[/k]

"Hey! I didn't start it."

[k]"What's 'The Moment'?"[/k]

"I have no idea! This is the first I've heard of it."

[k]"She's writing as though you know what she's talking about."[/k]

"I must have missed a note somewhere."

[k]"If it was in the laundromat, it's under a thousand tons of garbage now."[/k]

"Crap! Of course, she might just be being cryptic again."

[k]"What's the other side say?"[/k]

"The Moment" in this adventure will, alas, not be played by Billie Piper.
