The watch is gone. 

She feels around in the bed, knowing it won't be there. She checks under the pillow, pointlessly, she would have felt it earlier.

Crap! Crap crap crap. That can't be good.

Thanks, but this is not one of her shirts. She does not recognize this fine gentleman but she's kinda glad for the backup right now. Her cool jacket is nowhere to be seen.

She goes to stand but as her foot hits the floor she realizes that, beyond the dinosaur shirt, she's not wearing any clothes.
