[quote="Sarah Hubbard"]I've been a +1 reader for a long time, but I finally decided to get a disqus account so I could comment. :P This. Story. Is. FANTASTIC!!!!! Kudos to you, Jack, for your dedication!!!!

Here goes a suggestion: 
This may be an unnecessary diversion, but I think it could be really interesting and possibly useful if Horatio (or more accurately, the human that Horatio once was) had a dream sequence describing what exactly he/she saw all those years ago at Astre Sucre.

Josephine told us the end result--that they were all erased from existence--but did this person see something that could help somehow in defeating or neutralizing the Botfly? Could Bina & Co turn Its power against It? Could Bina actually use Horatio to gain access to that time and place?

So many ideas, sorry! :P[/quote]

Hi Sarah! Welcome to the PTP! Don't worry, you never have to apologize for idea! Ideas are great. :)

I'm glad you're choosing to do the whole talking thing, that is super cool!

Thank you so much for reading!
