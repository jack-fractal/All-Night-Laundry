"Date not going so well huh?" asks the Pizza Girl?

[k]"What?"[/k] says Kendra, distracted. [k]"Oh - yeah, not so well I guess. I thought I was maybe getting through to him there though..."[/k]

"Still! There's always pizza!" says the girl, with the forced cheerfulness of someone who still hasn't been paid.

[k]"Right, how much was that again?"[/k]

[quote="tegerioreo"]Kendra: Pay for the dang pizza already.[/quote]

They do the paying for money dance. Kendra gives her another $100 because she had to witness all the shouting. 

"So you don't want this second pizza now?"

[k]"No, I need you to take it to Western General. In the emergency waiting room, there'll be a girl wearing a purple shirt, shorts, and a labcoat. I need you to give her the pizza and this note. She'll probably ask where the pizza came from - don't answer her, just leave."[/k]

"All right..." says the Pizza Girl. "Whatever you say. You know, there's this thing these days called [i]cellphones.[/i] They're more efficient form of communication then pi - Hey, are you OK?"

[quote="Anonymous Person"]I could have sworn the pizza delivery person was a guy. Paradox?[/quote]

Kendra shivers as the wind picks up.
