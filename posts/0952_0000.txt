[quote="tegerioreo"]Another blanket?  Is it good to bundle up somebody who has a fever?[/quote]

Usually, yeah, but with a fever that high... 

Kendra settles for getting her a glass of water. 

[k]"Drink this."[/k]

"Mmmrrrmm..."

[k]"[i]Now[/i] Bina."[/k]

"OK, OK..."

From downstairs, they hear the sound of Elizabeth's voice, [e]"Hey! What is wrong with this television?"[/e]

[k]"That's not a television!"[/k] calls Kendra through the door, [k]"Please don't touch anything!"[/k]

[e]"Are you almost done up there?"[/e]

[k]"Yes! Just hold on a minute,"[/k] yells Kendra before turning to Bina who is finishing her water. [k]"Are you going to be OK for a few minutes Bina?"[/k]

"Mmmhmm... I'm just s-super."

[k]"OK, finish the water and then try to rest,"[/k] she says before turning to the door and yelling, [k]"Be right there!"[/k]
