"We should get the journal now. I mean, before anyone comes."

[k]"Yeah... that's probably a good idea. Tricky to explain. But you should put on the suit first. You really don't want any more cuts."[/k]

"No I do not."

[k]"God, these are pretty heavy."[/k]

"There's a table over by the tent. You could drop them there."

[k]"Aha, a table,"[/k] says Kendra, setting them down, [k]"You know there was a skeleton behind these? In the tent?"[/k]

"Oh god, was it Kate or Josh?"

[k]"What? No no! It was one of the bodies. The old bodies. The ones they found."[/k]

"Oh, was it really gross?"

[k]"Not really. The other bodies though... [i]they're[/i] pretty gross. I looked through the files."[/k]

"Urgh, how gross is gross?"

[k]"Pretty gross."[/k]

One of the lights goes out.

[k]"You think that was us?"[/k] asks Kendra.

"I dunno, maybe."

[quote="CrimsonMage"]>Well no point delaying it. Put on the suits![/quote]

[k]"Lets just get those suits, ok? I'll feel better once we're wearing them."[/k]

"Yeah," says Bina, "Yeah, good idea."
