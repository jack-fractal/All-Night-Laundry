[quote=Redsoff;7578720]>That's...not good. Stay away from the bad smell.[/quote]

But it is so INTERESTING!

Even though its bad.

[quote='?[GimeurCookie];7578834']> It seems the bad smell is playing hide and go seek underground! Dig dig![/quote]

[quote=tegerioreo;7579232]Smell up all the bad smell; that's the best way to get rid of it.[/quote]

I go dig!

Dig dig dig!

"Piotyr! Where are you hiding now? Come out now, I think we are in the trouble with the building lady. Again. Come to otets! Come on my little Piotyr! Where are you?"

[i]This is where it happens, right?[/i]

The girl-that-smells-like-that is beside me. She wasn't here before, except she was. She was always here, and always not here. I wish she would make up her mind.

[i]This is where the bad thing happens.[/i]

[img]0351_b.png[/img]

Yes. This is where it happens.

[i]I thought so.[/i]

I am digging. I like digging. Digging is an important thing. 

The bad smell is everywhere now. It mixes with the smell coming from the-girl-that-smells-like-that, and the machine-monsters, and the dirt. It smells of bad meat, and dry stone, and burning. 

And it smells like dying. 

It is interesting, even though it is scary, even though it doesn't smell right. 

I want to know what it is.

[i]Is it very bad? The thing about to happen.[/i]

Yes. It is very bad.

[i]Oh. Crap... I'm sorry.[/i]

I lick the girl on the chin and she makes a funny coughing noise.

[i]Can I - can I do anything? Can I go back and - [/i]

I tell her no. I tell her that its not allowed. I tell her that THAT is not how you play the GAME. 

I tell her that, after it happens, Packleader gets very angry and sad and he hits the driver-man in the face he falls down and there is lots of shouting and the angry-building-lady shows up and there is more shouting and then they let him hold me until it is over. 

The girl-who-smells-like-that makes the choking noise again and then makes sad smells.

She rubs my back over and over while I dig.

[i]I don't know if I can watch this. Piotyr, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I don't want to leave you alone, I don't, but I don't know if I can do it. I don't know if I can watch it.[/i]
