[quote=Kíeros;7625692]> See if any of the bodies would be what was bleeding there.[/quote]

Noo, doesn't look like it. They're all just sitting in their trays.

This doesn't feel real. It feels like a movie set.

Why would these bodies be here? Wouldn't they move them to the surface? We've got to be missing something.

[quote=Lacemaker;7625602]From what little I know of crime shows, it's not a gunshot wound because there's no splatter*. Other than that, a pool would suggest a steady source dripping over time, probably dripping down from something.

Double check there's not a body hanging above you, just to be safe.[/quote]

Looks clear.

That would have been exceptionally awful if it had been true. 

But it isn't. No hanging body. 

Just the blood. 

Hmm. 

[quote=Lacemaker;7625602]As for Bina, stay within earshot, and call out every once in awhile to make sure she's still there and doing ok, but don't look unless you think there's a problem. That system seems to work pretty well for bathroom breaks on camping trips, and should do fine here as well.[/quote]

"Hey Bina! You ok?"[/k]

"Yes! I'm fine! No need for you to come out here! All good! Please! OK?"

[k]"All right!"[/k]
