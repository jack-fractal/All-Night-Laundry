"Talk to the door."

[color=#C10087]"It doesn't even have a handle!"[/color]

"That doesn't matter! This is a dream!"

[color=#C10087]"Sure! Whatever! Maybe you should do it really fast then, 'cause the giant time thingy - [/color]

"The giant undead dream time dog?"

[color=#C10087]"Yes! That thing! It's kind of running at us really fast!"[/color]

[quote="K25fF"]>Well, that makes sense. Give that door a stern talking-to.[/quote]

"Right! Yes. OK. Hey door! You need to open anywhere other then here. Right now. OK? You got that. [i]ANYWHERE other then here![/i]"

I open the door.

>>>NOTES:

Hey everyone! I'm visiting my family this weekend for a combination birthday and easter celebration that Morphimus has helpfully named "Beaster", which is the best name for a celebration ever. 

Unfortunately, while I was diligently packing up all my electronics, including my tablet, I forgot to pack my tablet pen. Clever me. So now I have a well packed and highly expensive table weight and I can't draw anything tonight. I probably won't be able to draw anything tomorrow or Sunday either. 

Boo hiss!

I feel very silly, but unfortunately my family lives 500 kilometres away from where I live, so I can't just skip back home to pick it up. There is the vague possibility that I might be able to acquire a tablet pen tomorrow, but I doubt that is going to happen.

So! This means that you'll be getting a look at what my scripts look like before I stick images in them. I will replace the descriptions with images when I get my pen back. This is a very unfortunate place for this to happen, as this next scene is probably going to be both visually interesting and also fairly complicated.

This really bites. :(

EDIT: I did eventually go back and add the art for this. Go me!
