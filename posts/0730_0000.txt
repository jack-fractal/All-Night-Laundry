"Right," says Bina, finding herself calm, composed, her voice steady. "That settles that."

[quote=xooxu;7798300]Did you change the image in that last update, or was I high last night when I checked the update? I thought last night that the Not-Dog was still outside the window looking in, not like hanging in the window.[/quote]

It's [i]possible[/i] you were high, but I suspect it more likely that you simply slipped laterally between universes. That [i]is[/i] the image that I uploaded last night in this reality, but my first idea for that panel had Piotyr pressed up against the glass looking through it. In some other reality ([i]your[/i] reality) I probably ended up drawing it the other way. 

Most people only slip sideways like that once, maybe twice, in their life, so... I hope you like it here!

I can't tell if you're joking, but if you're not, I am sorry!
