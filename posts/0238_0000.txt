So the first thing to do, right, is to just try the obvious thing. Maybe all she has to do is touch the TV?

No. There's none of the itchy pulsing black stuff around the TV any more. It's nothing but mud covered plastic. 

Mostly.

She tries to believe that a tiny sizzle under her fingers means something. It's faint, if it's even there at all.

Maybe the black stuff is like... some kind of [i]charge[/i]? Maybe it got used up when Kendra touched it and it zapped her wherever it zapped her. 

Stop thinking like that! If that's true, then there's no way that Bina can go get her, and she WILL go get her, so thinking like that is NOT being helpful.

Maybe it had something to do with what she was doing AFTER she'd touched it? Kendra had kicked the TV, it had stopped doing the pulsing thing, and then what? 

She'd just been standing there talking...  sort of like this. 

Bina adopts the pose.

Nothing happens.

She feels a bit ridiculous. Like a kid trying to restart a nuclear reactor with a box of crayons.
