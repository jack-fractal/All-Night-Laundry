Jeepers! A [i]day?[/i]

Thank you for reading (so much, so quickly).

And thank you Chaz for telling people about this whole deal. That was very cool of you.

[quote="Chaz Wallace"]I have since helped to make sure we both check up on it daily. even if we don't post.[/quote]

Hey! Comments are nice, and I love them, even on days like today where I didn't take any, but I don't want anyone to feel like they [i]have[/i] to post. 

If you want some help remembering to check in I do recommend checking out Feedly, or another RSS feed. It's so much easier to keep track of stuff that way, though friends bugging you is probably still better. :)
