She's not going to think about it. Everything is terrible. Things will make more sense if she just rests a second. Not sleeping. Just... just a rest.

After a few more attempts to shake her shoulder Kendra stops talking. That's good.

It turns out that she was just shifting position so she could do this.

Hi TD! Thanks for reading!

I am sick again! Hurray (not hurray)! Hopefully it is not strep this time.

Updates will be smaller for a few days while I get over this thing.
