"Where did you even get those?"

"The hospital gift store thing," says Amie. "I didn't steal them, I bought them."

"You had money?" asks Bina, who remembers Kendra saying that Amie had been in her pyjamas.

"I asked Kendra for some!"

"[i]You[/i] had money?" asks Bina, turning to Kendra.

[k]"Oh no, you two aren't pinning this one on me. [i]I[/i] said I didn't have any money, and she should ask Emmie,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"And what did [i]you[/i] say?"[/k]

"It seems that I have enabled the purchase of crocs," says Emmie. "Please forgive me."

[quote='BreadProduct']> Okay cool shoes but your foot is still injured you should stay off it as much as possible.[/quote]

"I don't know why you're all talking about shoes," says Mel. "You're not walking on this foot for a while."
