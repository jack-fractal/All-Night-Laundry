Amie says, "That doesn't necessarily mean -"

"They also all decided to wash their upholstery by leaving their doors open in the rain."

"Oh," says Amie. "Well butts."

"What!?" says Wong. "They [i]left!?[/i]"

"Yep!", says Bina, ignoring Wong. "That meets my criteria for bullshittery! Time to go! Kendra? You good?"

[quote="jaelen"]+1 reader. Zach, this is an amazing story. I read 1400 pages created by a random internet stranger in 4 days! Thank you for creating it (and thank you to all the readers who have been around for longer than I have for your contributions as well).[/quote]

Hi Jaelen! Welcome to the PTA. Thank [i]you[/i] for reading your way through those 1400 pages. Nicely done! I hope you stick around and make more suggestions!
