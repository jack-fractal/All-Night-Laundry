[k]"Remember, you still have the hospital basement to deal with,"[/k] says Kendra.

"I know," says Bina.

[quote="MidnightDStroyer"]Emmie, repeat your question when Kendra is done with the phone> "We're clearly doing damage every time we use time travel, right? So why do we have to use more time travel?"[/quote]

"Why... exactly do we have to do more time travel?" asks Emmie. "I think that all this blowtorching reality has to be serving the Botfly more then it serves us. Right?"

[quote="Boomer"]Hurray! After a week of off and on binge reading I finally caught up I sort of thought I was so far behind that ANL would be done by the time I got here. I only noticed today that the Current button link had changed from 1506 to 1507.

Loving the story and completely addicted.[/quote]

We're not done yet but we're gettin' there! :)
