"Well what was I supposed to do?"

[k]"I don't know, just..."[/k]

She trails off.

"God, are they [i]done[/i] yet?"

[k]"We - yeah, we're on the island. You just got the blanket out."[/k]

Another pause.

[k]"Thank you."

"OK? Thank you."[/k]

Bina tries to say something, she should, but she can't. She makes a sort of grunting noise. 

There's another awkward silence.

God, she is just the [i]worst[/i].

[k]"How long do you think we should wait for them to fall asleep?"[/k]

She can respond to that at least. 

"I dunno, it felt like instantly to me."

[k]"Yeah, ok. Lets give it five minutes then."[/k]
