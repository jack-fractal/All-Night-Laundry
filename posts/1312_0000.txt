[quote="Dave Rapp"]We are going to get Bina some shoes. And then we are going to get a very, very large can of bug spray.[/quote]

[quote="BookNerd"]I second the finding of shoes as Priority One.[/quote]

[k]"First we have to get Bina shoes,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"Then all we need to do is find the biggest can of bug spray in the world and -"[/k]

"That's never going to work," sighs Amie, and then, for some reason Bina doesn't understand, flinches.

[k]"Do you have a better idea?"[/k] asks Kendra. [k]"And how exactly did [i]you[/i] end up with shoes? You were in your pyjamas when we jumped the first time."[/k]

"Ohh," says Amie, the haunted expression on her face changing to that of simple guilt.

"[i]I[/i] have shoes now but - uh - well - Doctor Jordan Shipman, hospital clerk, does [i]not[/i]. At least, she does not have extra shoes, under her desk, any more."

[k]"Is that also where you got the labcoat?"[/k]

"Yeeeeesss...?" says Amie, drawing the word out, before continuing. "She wasn't using it!"

[k]"And I am sure everyone would understand if you told them that,"[/k] says Kendra, sarcasm crystallizing in the air around her. [k]"That's how possessions work, right?"[/k]

"Kendra, be nice," says Bina.
