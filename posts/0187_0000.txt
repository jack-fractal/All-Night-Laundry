All right. All right. 

Bina sticks the paperclip in her mouth.

Oh. Well that's just brilliant.

Two minutes before the roof caves in? Plenty of time. No pressure! If Bina ever meets this future-bina, or alternate-bina or whatever she's going to have PLENTY TO SAY.

Most of it involving SHOUTING VERY LOUDLY AND FLAILING HER ARMS!
