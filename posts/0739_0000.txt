[quote=badatnamesbluhbluh;7802433]>How could the other Binas spend [i]years[/i] here, when you barely have supplies for two weeks?[/quote]

Because the Moment appears to expend space to extend time, and the efficiency ratio of that exchange isn't very good.

After six years, there isn't much "here" left. 

[quote=Beastnix;7802254]>how is that arm, glowy any?[/quote]
[quote=BlueMoonHound;7802424]I would like to know as well.[/quote]

It's fine. 

Oh it's still glowing if she takes the bandages off, so she just doesn't take the bandages off. 

Problem solved.

Really.

It's under control.

[k]"Bina?"[/k] it's Kendra's voice from outside. This is followed a split second later by the galumphing clatter of Piotyr's claws on the hardwood as she barrels toward the front door. [k]"Are you up yet?"[/k]

"Yeah!" says Bina, grabbing her coffee and, after a seconds hesitation, her pills. "Coming!"
