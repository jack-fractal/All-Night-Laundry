Hi I'm Bina!

Uh, I think we've met before, right?

[quote="Gimeurcookie"]> What is Piotyr doing now?[/quote]

She's just sort of hanging out.

She's lying on her side now doing that sort of gargly snorty panting thing that dogs do when they're happy. I fed her some birthday cake earlier so she's sort of in a sugar-coma.

Yes! I'm talking about you! Who's a good girl? Who's a good girl!

Piotyr would like you to know that it is she! She is the good girl! That is who it is! She is [i]always[/i] a good girl!

Awww... she's such a goof!

[quote="TheEmptypot"]>Hey Bina! How are you I like your hair, it looks super cute![/quote]

Thanks!

I don't know if I like it this way though. I normally just wear it down, or sometimes braided if I'm playing hockey or running or something. 

But Lash loves messing with people's hair, and it's her birthday so I let her do this while we were watching the movie earlier.

I dunno. You don't think it's too, sorta, kiddie, do you?

[quote="Kíeros"]> So what's subconsciously bugging you?[/quote]

Nothing really.

OK OK! Fine! I mean, I don't really think we should be [i]doing[/i] this maybe. 

I know Laashya's parents aren't going to be home for three hours, so it's not like we're going to get caught, but... well... I dunno.

Sam says it's ok, and Lash went along with it, so I guess it's ok.

They never do find out about it, but I still wish we hadn't.

[quote="Kíeros"]Next time do "The end"
"For real"
"Of Chapter 6". That would get quite a few more than one.[/quote]

Oh ho! That would be SO MEAN. I don't think I could do that, that would just be cruel.

This was a fantastically positive review! It totally made my day.
