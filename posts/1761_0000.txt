Amie stands, because she really doesn't want to be the only one sitting during this conversation. 

"Did you find another journal?" asks Kendra. 

[quote="Zinvia"]Amie: CONFESS! [/quote]

"No," says Amie, all out of rope. "I found this."

"In the basement of the hospital."

"Is that the Moment?" asks Emmie.

"What happened to it?" asks Kendra.

Bina frowns and says "That's Gregor's watch."

[quote="Zinvia"]Someone: Chew her out for keeping the watch a secret for so long.[/quote]

After that, the conversation goes about as well as you'd expect.
