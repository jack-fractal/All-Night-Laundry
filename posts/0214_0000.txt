Yes! It's very good. 

She tries again, "I'm shuck. I stink."

That later part at least is true, but she had been trying to say 'I think.'

Mixed with the dust and ozone smell of smashed dryers is the overpowering reek of the mud. It's not a [i]bad[/i] smell exactly, but strong. It smells... burned, not unlike wood-smoke or burned meat, if you charred it long past the point where it had gone black until it became something like a charcoal briquette. 

And faintly sweet too. Weird.

At least she knows now how Gregor got his overalls so muddy now. He must have been down here in this mud, digging.

Thinking of that, he must STILL be down here somewhere.

Oh good. She was worried that she'd run out of things to be terrified of.

The idea of the big strange man out there in the dark, doing something mysterious with, oh what was the phrase that Kendra had used, "serial murderer plastic"? That was it. It's almost enough to make her panic all on its own.

But she doesn't. Instead, she starts to whistle, and begins slowly, ever so slowly, to ooze her way out from beneath the washing machine toward the sound of Kendra's splashing.

Tiny update today because I'm on the train. Lucky me that this coincides with a scene where there's no light. I didn't plan it this way, but it sure is convenient. :)

[quote="loneVision"]FiiiiiiiiiiiNALLY MADE IT TO THE MOST RECENT UPDATE! OMG JAAAAAACK ALL OF IT IS GLORIOUS![/quote]

Yay! You're back! I looked up your profile last week because I couldn't remember seeing you post in ages and I was worried that you'd left the site entirely. Glad to hear from you again!
