[quote=tegerioreo;7452660]Tell Kendra to keep talking or sing a song so you can use your Bina-senses to triangulate her location.

Follow the sound of her voice.  Before you get there, DOUSE THAT LIGHT[/quote]

[quote=Scionwoods;7453013]> Tell Kendra to keep talking then listen for which direction her voice is coming from.[/quote]

[quote=meganopteryx;7453105]Yes, yes, listening! Tell her to keep talking so you can go to the sound of her voice. Use the flashlight only to find your way across in that direction.[/quote]

"Can you steep walking? I can't find you. There's too much jump."

[k]"Uh, sure. OK. What should I talk about?"[/k]

"You mood sing a pond."

There's a moments silence.

[k]"Sing a song?"[/k]

"Please!"

[k]"Right, uh, OK. Sure. Sing a song." [/k]

There's another few seconds of silence and then Kendra starts singing [k]"I can see clearly now, the rain is gone..."[/k]

Except, of course, that she can't, and it hasn't. 

Ha ha, Kendra. Ha ha.

Now where IS she hiding? Maybe a little further on? The echoes from the curved roof are very confusing. Ok, she HAS to be just past this - 

Wait.

Kendra pushed some boards right? Like... way back when Bina just woke up?
