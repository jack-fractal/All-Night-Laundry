[quote="Crowstone"]employees only?
why's it say that on the door if its a fire exit?[/quote]

She's guessing it's because it's a fire door, not a normal entrance used by customers. Still, that's pretty irresponsible of them. 

She'll be sure to add that to her list of complaints.

[quote="Fuade"]>Remember the layout of the town you're in.  Does it seem normal for a fire exit to be located on this wall?[/quote]

Uh, it's a little weird, but not TOO weird. This is a side door, not a back door, and would normally have opened out into an alley, which would itself have lead back to the parking lot. A bit awkward, but this area has a lot of old buildings which have been cut up and reused so many times you end up with doors in weird places.

She's going to push soft and slow, unless or until the alarm sounds then she's going to kick it in and run like hell.

Eeeeeasy does it.

[color=#696969]Girl? Do you speak the French? You must tell police woman that she must stop with the shouting now and the tugging at the rope or he will have to hit her with shovel again.

He does not WANT to hit her with the shovel anymore but she must be quiet and stop making the yelling.
