They walk for about fifteen minutes, it might be longer. Bina's various bumps and bashes have had an opportunity to remind her that they're there.

[k]"I think so,"[/k] says Kendra.

[k]"The map isn't very clear in this section. I don't think they got out this way much. But I'm pretty sure we're going the right way."[/k]

"I don't remember any of this," says Bina, gesturing around at their surroundings, "Why aren't we just going back the way we went before?"

[k]"Because we don't want to go through the camp,"[/k] says Kendra. Then, noticing Bina's expression, she adds, [k]"We [i]don't[/i] want to go through the camp. Right?"[/k]

"We don't?"
