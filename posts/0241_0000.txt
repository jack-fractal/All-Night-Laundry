The TV is still screen down in the mud. 

The surge of adrenaline leaves her. She shivers.

She's jumping at shadows. Getting jumpy.

Jumpy-er.

More jumpy.

>>>NOTES:

Thank you for calling that out Dalm.

It is a very odd suggestion, TaintedBlood. It's gender essentialist, out of character for Bina and just plane weird. The implication that you can only care about the threatened life of people you want to have sex with, is a really unfortunate one.

Not cool.
