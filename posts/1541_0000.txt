[quote="auronblidook"]Hey Kendra notice how the wind isn't affecting the pizza girl?[/quote]

Oh bloody hell. Her vector is fuzzing. She must be fucking something up, something obvious, something - 

[k]"Uhh... wait - you're a girl."[/k]

"Eeeeyup," says the Pizza Girl, and Kendra can tell from the tone of her voice that this was a very bad thing to say if she wants Pizza Girl to trust her.

[k]"Sorry - umm - I just mean - look, quick [i]insane[/i] question - "[/k]

"There seems to be a lot of that going around."

[k]"Yep! Sorry! I know! Look, just - was there another person who was maybe going to deliver this pizza and then didn't?"[/k]

"What?"

[k]"Was there another driver who was [i]going[/i] to deliver this pizza but [i]didn't[/i] end up doing that for some reason?"[/k]

"Uh... what? I mean it was Guillaume's turn but you were offering so much money so I offered to do the actual delivery in exchange for half the money..."

Oh no.

"Is this some kind of kidnapping thing? Are you trying to kidnap Guillaume?"

[k]"What? No! What?! Why would you - [i]crap![/i]"[/k]

Kendra's brain freezes as the wind increases again and she finds herself wishing that Bina was here. She's much better at this kind of temporal nonsense.

>>>NOTES:

[quote="Asthanius"]This is an especially strange paradox, because the pizza delivery person was a guy just a few moments ago: 

"Ah! I am glad he is not coming down other side of building."[/quote]

This one is 'cause they both misgendered our delivery lady here, due to the distance and the fact that they were both expecting a dude.
