[quote=xooxu;7878947]Shouldn't tell her what?[/quote]

[k]"What do you mean Bina?"[/k]

"The B-botfly. C-can't t-tell about t-that."

[k]"But this is her [i]job[/i] Bina! She might even know how to kill it!"[/k]

"N-no. The botfly l-lies, or w-worse it [i]d-doesn't[/i] lie and it c-can actually d-do what it p-promises!"

[k]"What it promises? You think it's actually talking to Gregor?"[/k]

"M-maybe? - Yes? - I don't k-know b-but that's n-not what I meant. It m-made promises to o-other p-people too. Joesephine -"

[k]"You think it talked to Josephine?"[/k]

"N-no! Shh! Let m-me t-think! Joesephine wanted to make f-flying p-palaces, and to s-solve all the w-worlds problems w-with elect-t-ricity. The b-botfly g-gave her a way to d-do that."

[k]"It made electricity when people looked at the symbol."[/k]

"Y-yes. It's s-so hungry. If it c-can't g-get people to w-watch it w-with bribery, it will g-get someone to kidnap t-them and [i]force[/i] them to look at it. G-gregor w-was n-no Josephine. No flying palaces for h-him. He w-wanted something else, s-something less useful t-then in-infinite energy in t-terms of attracting p-people. S-something p-personal."

[k]"What - Piotyr? You think he did all this because his [i]dog[/i] died?"[/k]

"Y-yeah. It s-sounds s-silly but I t-think his d-deal prob-probably h-has to d-do with b-bringing her b-back from the d-dead."

[k]"That doesn't seem to have gone off particularly well. If Gregor was willing to kidnap all these people in order to revive her, I can't imagine he's happy with the version of Piotyr that is the Hound."[/k]

"M-maybe n-not, but s-she's [i]alive[/i]. W-wish g-granted. That's what it d-does. G-give the b-botfly what it w-wants, [i]feed[/i] it, help it [i]become[/i], and it g-gives you what y-you want. It's n-not p-perfect, not the way you w-would l-like maybe, but you g-get enough to k-keep you c-coming back. I-it m-makes you [i]useful[/i]. Y-you d-don't even h-have to know it exists t-to m-make th-the deal. J-joesephine certainly d-didn't. You j-just have to be c-close enough f-for it to n-notice you."

[k]"OK, I think you might be kind of jumping to conclusions again, but even if you're right, and I hope you're [i]not,[/i] but even if you [i]are[/i] right, I think Elizabeth might still be OK. I haven't known her very long, and most of that time she was threatening to stab me with a pair of scissors, but she seems to have her head screwed on straight. I don't think she'll pull a Gregor on us and-"[/k]

"D-doesn't m-matter. Sh-she could be f-fine and it s-still w-wouldn't m-matter. D-do you t-trust her b-bosses? W-what about th-their b-bosses? She's part of an o-organization. If you t-tell, and [i]she[/i] tells,  the information g-gets everywhere! Eventually t-that information g-gets into the h-hands of someone who [i]isn't[/i] f-fine. F-forget the b-botfly w-waking up f-for a s-second and ih-imagine w-what happens when H-Her Greenness t-tries to g-grant the wish of a [i]real[/i] monster."

That's a disconcerting thought. 

"Please K-Kendra..."

"Y-you [i]c-can't[/i] t-tell her. ..."

Ah! Yes, it is pretty danged high. I had it written down twice in different ways and I ended up with the higher one because that was what was written in the image description block. 

Anyway, I've reduced it a bit. Bina is sick, but not dying.

Not yet at any rate.

Praise be unto THE KRINGLE and may his terrible presence pass us by un-noticed for another year.
