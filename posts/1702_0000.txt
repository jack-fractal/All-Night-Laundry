OHSHITOHSHITOHSHIT!

If the dog drops down here she really [i]is[/i] going to have to throw a rock and run - and hope the universe doesn't implode or explode or whatever kind of ploding involves her screwing up [i]everything[/i],

But... Piotyr doesn't drop down - not right away at least.

"No," says Gregor again, cajoling. "Look - it is this way? This way is much better, yes? "

Above her, the floor creaks again, and she can hear the sound of Gregor's boots on the wooden floor. 

OK - OK, that's good.

[quote="Sevenblazes"]Telling them to jump in a pit might not work now, you'll have to give them a different order. They just heard Gregor say "do not go in the hole", so they might think that's part of their orders now.[/quote]

Ah crap! OK - that's annoying. She just needs to find something else to tell them!

[quote="Sevenblazes"]Also, keep in mind that he said "She is not here. She is up, fifth floor I am thinking?" So if the Naughts were ordered to get Bina, they might start heading up now. Watch to see what this one does.[/quote]

She almost starts to relax -
