"I'm so sick of being [i]cute[/i]!"

[k]"Hey! There have been days where I would have killed to be cute."[/k]

"Argh! I know! That's the worst bit. I can't even be mad about it because I [i]know[/i] it's crazy narcissistic and I shouldn't care and uuurgh... I'm just so [i]short[/i] and you would not [i]believe[/i] the number of times Lash has been asked who her 'little sister' is when we're out together and - Argh - I just wish I could pull off [i]hot[/i] sometimes."

[k]"I'm sure you pull it off just fine Bina."[/k]

Oh god, what does [i]that[/i] mean?

[quote=Amphasaurus;7824989]Ask Kendra for her sexual orientation. Don't get confused because of her thinking you can be cute.[/quote]

She [i]should[/i] leave it alone, she's had enough embarrassment for one day, but...

"So, um... I'm guessing you're not-"

[k]"Oh, I thought I was gay for a while."[/k]

"Uhh..."

Bina's not really sure how to respond to that.

[k]"Oh! I mean - no, not like that. I didn't -"[/k]

[quote=Morphimus;7824891]> Kendra: Reveal sexual orientation.[/quote]

[k]"God, that sounded bad. I mean - I still like mostly guys, [i]that[/i] didn't change. It's just that later I realized that I'm... not... one."[/k]

Bina realizes that, even though Kendra isn't looking at her, she's being watched very carefully.
