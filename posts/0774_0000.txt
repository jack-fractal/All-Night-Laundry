[quote="Maltor Drey"]If so, it's a pretty damn convincing one.[/quote]

[k]"Uhhh... I mean, we've travelled through time Bina. If it's a trick, it's a pretty good one."[/k]

"No! Not like that. I mean, it works, right? So it's [i]real[/i] but that doesn't make it not a trick."

[quote=wolftamer9;7821520]> You mean a prank, or a "B3 orchestrated everything" type of trick?[/quote]

[k]"So you're saying, what? This is some kind of trap set by Three? I know Twelve was really down with the 'Three was totes evil' theory, but I'm not really sold on-"[/k]

"No! Not Three! Who cares about her? She's just me with a running start."

[k]"Uh... what then?"[/k]

"Giant bug, from space!"

[k]"What?"[/k]

"Giant bug from space!!!"

[k]"Yes, I heard you. I was asking for further explanation, not for you to just repeat yourself louder."[/k]

"I don't know if it needs further explanation. It's a fairly self-contained statement."

[k]"You're talking about the Botfly?"[/k]

"Do you know any [i]other[/i] giant bug from space?"

[k]"No."[/k]

"Then I'm talking about the Botfly, OK? It's an alien, or god, or demon or something. It's [i]there[/i], it's the cause of all of this, and we keep not talking about it."

[k]"OK, yeah. And?"[/k]

"And? Well what does a giant bug from space have to do with time travel?"

[k]"Well, clearly it's a time travelling giant bug from space, Bina. I mean, time travel is happening, right? So, following logically..."[/k]

"Yes! But maybe the reason it's happening isn't because time travel is an innate part of being a giant space bug, but instead it's happening because the giant space bug [i]wants it to happen[/i].
