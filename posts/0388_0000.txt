[quote="ArcusofBrambles"]Oh yes, because two half frozen, near physically exhausted people who have never had a moment of training in how to properly sneak about are going to be able to subtly hijack a crane without anyone noticing.  Well, break a leg you two![/quote]

"You realize that my only experience in sneaking consists entirely of the one time that I tried to get into my appartment after a concert while my parents were asleep when I was seventeen, right? A task at which I did very badly and as a result of which I think I may technically still be grounded."

[k]"Uh, no, I did not know that. How did you - ?"[/k]

"A bowl of fruit was involved."

[k]"Rrriight."[/k]

[quote="tegerioreo"][i]Sneaking[/i] in [strike]ankle[/strike][i]thigh[/i]-deep ice-cold mud?  Sure, Kendra.  Should be a breeze.  Go for it.[/quote]

"I'd also like to point out that we are also in freezing mud that's up to my [i]thighs[/i], a fact which is currently negating our ability to walk in a non-splashing mannor?"

[k]"Ok, ok, I get it. It was a bad idea."[/k]

"No no! We should try it. I mean, this situation cannot exactly be made [i]worse[/i] at t-this point can it? I mean, aside from the badgers and snakes you mentioned earlier."

[k]"All right! Jeeze. Can we at least try to get a look at them before they see us? Or do you think that will cause the roof to fall in on us or something?"[/k]

"It might do that anyway, I honestly don't know how its still st..."

[k]"Come on! You're the one who doesn't want to get dissected."[/k]

"All right, all right. Sure. Lets give it a go."

Several cold, wet and awkward minutes later.

"Well this has gone GREAT, I d-don't see anyone. Do you?"

[k]"No. I hear something though, machinery."[/k]

"It's an industrial s-sump. They must be p-pumping out the water from behind the sandbags."

[k]"How can you possibly identify that by [i]sound[/i]."[/k]

"I s-spent a lot of time on construction sites when I was a kid!"
