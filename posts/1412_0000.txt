[k]"Look, I might be biased I know. Being kidnapped, beaten up, and repeatedly time murdered can do that to a person, but I think you have to admit Amie that it's not really a [i]shotgun[/i] that you're little bug girl is playing with. It's a lot more like a nuclear bomb."[/k]

"These analogies are kinda getting out of hand," mutters Bina to herself.

"But Bina just said I'm [i]right[/i] and she's [i]not[/i] super dangerous," says Amie, sounding tired and frustrated.

[k]"And I sure hope that's the case,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"I mean - I'm certainly not rooting for apocalyptic level evil here. I'd love to think that even if we fuck up, there will still be poutine and chocolate and cat videos for the people who haven't been vaporized, but I'm not sure I believe that."[/k]

"When has she ever vaporized anyone!?" says Amie. 

"The police outside the hospital," says Emmie. "There was one of them... he... was sort of... [i]dragged[/i]..."

[k]"To be honest,"[/k] says Kendra, patting Emmie on the arm. [k]"I'm kind of hoping for only nuclear bomb level badness as a fail state, but I've read a lot of Derleth, and if you're wrong in your [i]guess[/i] about the relative scale of our spooky alien bug girl, then things could go really [i]really[/i] badly. I remind you, she altered the weather system of an entire [i]continent,[/i] while powered by only [i]four[/i] humans, and still [i]half asleep[/i]."[/k]

"But - but [i]the Doctor[/i] would do it."
