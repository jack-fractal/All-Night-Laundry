[quote="powerfulPlutonium"]>BECAUSE I TOOK IT BECAUSE IT WAS THERE! I KNOW I SHOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN IT, BUT I DID. YOU ARE NO LESS INTENSE IN ANY TIMELINE/ITERATION, SO I KNOW THAT IF I TOLD YOU THIS *EXACT* DISCUSSION WOULD OCCUR. I DIDN'T WANT TO BE YELLED AT OKAY?[/quote]

"Because you're kinda scary and also maybe the Doctor and you were [i]sick[/i] and I didn't want to stress you out, and because I was worried you won't trust me any more ever, and I can't afford an apartment on my own and if we get out of this we're still going to be room-mates and I didn't want it to be weird and - and because I really didn't want to have this conversation!"

Amie thinks that's about half of it but she's run out of breath. 

"You think I'm scary?"

Bina looks a little hurt at the suggestion.

"A little. You're kinda intense Bina."

"I'm not [i]intense,[/i]" says Bina, intensely.

"Hah, yeah, OK," says Amie. "This is why I didn't want to have this conversation."

"Yeah, well sucks to be you because now you're going to have to have this conversation at least three times!"
