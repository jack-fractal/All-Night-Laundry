[quote="tegerioreo"]So, who was that on the phone?[/quote]
[quote="xooxu"]>Inquire about the phone call. Are they sending down the "gondola" or what?[/quote]

"So what happened? Was that what's-her-name again? Is she coming? Is she letting us out?"

[k]"Yeah,"[/k] says Kendra, [k]"But she couldn't phone her boss."[/k]

"Why not?"

[k]"She said the external phone-line is down. Apparently they can't keep anything electrical working properly anywhere nearby, including the phones. She wanted to go to her car and grab her cellphone, but I convinced her to come get us out of the hole first."[/k]

"That's good, I don't want to stay down here another minute!"

[k]"It is, and she says that it's not unusual for the phones to be down, everything is always breaking, but..."[/k]

"But cutting the phone-line really sounds like something Gregor would do?"

[k]"It really does."[/k]

"Where did we leave our useful, convenient, and above all [i]heavy[/i] walking sticks?"

[k]"I left mine over in the tent with all the shoes in it."[/k]

"Lets go get those hmm?"

[k]"What an excellent idea."[/k]

Above them, with the loud coughing sputter of a diesel engine, the gondola begins its slow descent.

[k]"Oh thank god."[/k]
