It looks yellowey from outside. No sickly green pulsing writhing snakelike eating dreamlike drifting burning freezing growing stuff.

Just regular old light.

No, the curtains are drawn. Wait... there are curtains? That's pretty weird for a portable office. Normally they have blinds.

Mind you, the fact that the office is in the pit and not the parking lot is also strange. It can't be for the construction company. They'd have to dig AROUND the office, which doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

Bina taps on the window.
