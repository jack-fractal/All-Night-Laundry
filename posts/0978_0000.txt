Well she'd bought if for zombies...

[e]"What are you saying it doesn't work? I thought you said you wanted the third one."[/e]

[k]"No, I wanted the one FOR [i]three[/i]. That would be cable 'A'. I [i]lettered[/i] the cables and [i]numbered[/i] the pylons. For clarity."[/k]

[e]"Oh yes, it's [i]very[/i] clear. How could I ever have become confused?"[/e]

[k]"Har har, you [i]still[/i] plugged them in wrong. Now it's all back to front. Look, just unplug that one and give it to me."[/k]

[quote=Dave]You're not asking us to do it. We're doing this bro. We're making this happen.[/quote]

Aww... OK! I will do this thing. I need to find prizes (they will likely be art supply related), but here's me plan. Anyone who does any fan related things, and tells me about them, from now until the 1000th day, which is February 13th, will get entered in a draw.

I will figure out prizes over the weekend. You are all lovely people. Thank you so much.
