"How bad?"

[k]"The second shot was a through and through but it hit her lung, which collapsed, and broke some ribs on the way out."[/k]

"Oh damn..." Bina can't think of anything else to say to that.

[k]"And that's the umm... the [i]good[/i] one."[/k]

"The other one is worse?"

[k]"The first shot, the one we didn't see, was lower. It hit her pelvis, the uh - the upper part, and cracked it, then bounced... somewhere. We know it missed the internal iliac artery because she's [i]alive[/i] but they don't know where it is and they haven't gotten it out yet. They're not sure how much damage it did yet."[/k]

"They're not sure?! How are they not sure?"

[k]"They can't get imaging to work. No x-rays, no CT or MRI's, though they wouldn't use that one because that would be bad with the missing bullet. Last I heard, they're going to try to go in laparoscopically, but they're having an issue with that because the cameras are giving them trouble."[/k]

"But we shut down the portal!" says Bina. "And I'm all the way down here! I'm as far away from radiology as I can get! Should I-"

[k]"It's not you Bina."[/k]

"What?"

[k]"She..."[/k] Kendra pauses, then continues. [k]"She fell in the mud."[/k]
