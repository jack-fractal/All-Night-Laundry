[quote=KanjiGirl;7875183]Could she have gotten into one of the houses?[/quote]

Maybe, but why? She could have broken a window or something...

[quote=Bohandas;7875184]>How well was she cleaned up and/or how cleanly were the stitches done? There might be a trail of blood to follow.[/quote]

The stitches are fine! A little messy maybe, but she's never stitched SKIN before and scalps are surprisingly stretchy. 

Besides, she put a bandage over it. The bandage is, admittedly, held on with scotch-tape, but surgical tape is in surprisingly short supply in the Moment right now.

[quote=xooxu;7875188]The moment is centered around the laundromat, right? Maybe she was trying to get to the construction yard behind it, where the hole is. Where she knows. I doubt it's still there completely with how small the moment is now, but it might be where she's trying to go.[/quote]

Right! That makes sense! She's probably trying to call for help. 

Now, would she have gone around or... 

Aha!
