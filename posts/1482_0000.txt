[quote="In which I comment"]Just caught up yesterday! Really happy to finally be in the PTP with you guys! I had written a long comment about story development and speculation and was really bummed out when I couldn't see it here. I think it got blocked as spam because I mentionned the name of the website I saw an ad for ANL on. 

I think Emmie shouldn't make it to the others. Maybe his glasses fly out and it's the only thing that reaches Bina and Co in time to get to the moment.[/quote]

Hi In Which I Comment! Welcome to the PTP! I originally typed that as the PTC, so I think I'm just going bow to the inevitable and make it my [i]thing[/i] now that I always mess that up.

Anyway! I had not checked the spam filter in a few days and I am sorry your comment, as well as a few others, got caught in there. I've approved it now. I'll try to keep a better watch on that, or... possibly turn it off. We haven't attracted any spambots and the only things that get caught in there are comments like yours. :(
