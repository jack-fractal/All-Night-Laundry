After a few minutes, when Bina's head starts to nod down toward her chest again. 

[k]"OK, you done?"[/k]

[quote="KÃ­eros"]> Bina: Keep arguing.[/quote]

"Yeah, but -"

[k]"All right, come on. We're taking a look at your knees, you're downing the rest of the antibiotics, then you're going to bed."[/k]

"But what about Elizabeth?"

[quote="SNORKELBITCHMEGAHITLER"]>Elizabeth, don't die I the next little while[/quote]

"But she's lying on the sidewalk..."

[k]"Which is [i]hard[/i]. For the moment, that's the best I can do for her in terms of not making any spinal injuries she has any worse. Come on, up."[/k]

"Shouldn't leave her..."

[k]"Which is why you should stop arguing and let me get back to helping her."[/k]

"Can't go to hospital Kendra. I'm all... glowey. If I go to the hospital.. bad stuff'll happen."

[k]"Let me worry about that OK? You just worry about you right now. Do you need me to carry you up the stairs?"[/k]

"No," says Bina, offended, but in the end, it's a very close thing.
