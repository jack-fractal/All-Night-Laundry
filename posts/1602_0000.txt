[quote=Matthew Helbers]Amie: Be confused with spotty memory[/quote]

Amie has no idea how she got where she is. She has a vague memory of the plane, of Kendra and Emmie yelling, and then the time vortex, but after that... nothing. Just this soft white bed. 

The bed itself is cool, the sheets are clean, and the mattress is far too nice for it to be her own tough second-hand futon. Beyond that, the feeling of the space around her is wrong, this is not a bedroom. 

She sits up. 

This...

... is not a familiar place at all.

The movement of sitting up doesn't hurt, but for some reason, she feels like it should.
