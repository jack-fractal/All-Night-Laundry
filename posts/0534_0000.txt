[quote="wolftamer9"]I just want to say yeah, I'm convinced. B3's the Green Lady. The stopwatch practically proves it (though I guess it could still be Josephine). She's the target.[/quote]

No.

No no no.

No. 

[quote="wolftamer9"]> Remember what you're dealing with, Bina. The Botfly is a parasite. She may not even be herself anymore.[/quote]

That is not true. 

[k]"Find anything good?"[/k]

No! Uh uh! Nope.

[k]"Like, anything that would help? I'm kind of drawing a blank on what to do next."[/k]

Nope. No. How would that even work?

[k]"Hellooo? Earth to Bina!"[/k]

"Sorry! Yes, useful stuff. A bit."

It's impossible, right? She couldn't - 

[k]"And.... that stuff iiiiiiis?"[/k]

Bina tries to pull her thoughts together.

"Uh, right, ok. Um... stuff, right."

"Uh, I think the Moment is maybe also sort of a place? Like. The way she talks about it in here, it's somewhere where there's, like, space? There's a cafe at least, and you can spend a lot of time there. Like... [i]lots[/i] of time. Maybe."

[k]"So why call it the Moment then? That seems - [/k]

"No no, I think it's also a time too. Uh. Like it's a moment, in time, that just keeps going? Like a loop? I mean, like a tiny loop, of the same time, over and over again. That... that doesn't make any sense, but you get what I'm saying right?"

[k]"Yeah, I get it, like the Factory. You said it was sort of dead, right? Frozen. The sun didn't move. Like the same second was getting recycled over and over again."[/k]

"Yes! Like that!"

[k]"You think [i]that[/i] place is the Moment?"[/k]

"Errr... maybe?" 

She hadn't really thought about that.

"I don't [i]think[/i] so. I mean, I think I'd just call it 'The Sugar Factory', if I were, you know, talking about it, like, I wouldn't call it 'the Moment'. That'd be weird."

[k]"Hmm."[/k]

"There's stuff there that could be useful. Tools. Like, for time travel. B12 calls them 'Devices'."

[k]"Yeah, but - [/k]

"Yeah but it's probably playing into Team Green's plans if we go there now. I know."

[quote="a52"](why does Bina have to be so goddamn adorable when she makes faces like that)[/quote]
Science!

Holy theorycraft batman! That was an interesting read.

[quote="wolftamer9"](Just putting this here because I'll forget if I put it off 'til the end of my readthrough. Jack, you never added some of the missing images from Bina's third dream, with the not-dog and the static in the laundromat.)[/quote]

Thanks! Yeah, I keep meaning to go back and do those. The second retcon isn't finished either. I don't know how I'm going to find the time to do those.
