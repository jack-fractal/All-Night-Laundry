[quote="Dalmationer"]Maybe it's something to do with this place being pretty 'stable', so to speak. There isn't any paradox to power it.
Or maybe there just isn't enough electricity.[/quote]

They've got a lot of electricity, it just isn't working. 

[k]"Here, just like - hold this against the back wall so I can use the mirror."[/k]

Kendra hands Bina a tiny maglight. They have lots of flashlights now.

"Like this?"

[k]"Err, no other side. Wrong hand."[/k]

"Oh! Right yeah, that would be bad."

[k]"Just scoot in a bit further and - ok. There. Hold it. Yeah, like that."[/k]

Kendra inserts a long thin piece of wire with a tiny mirror on the end into a small gap in the device. 

[quote="tegerioreo"]Bina:  Hold the light.  Make small talk.[/quote]

"Soooooo... I'm thinking omelettes?"

There is a loooooooong silence. Kendra wiggles the little mirror on a wand around in the back of the modified TV.

"I mean, for breakfast. I don't just randomly think about egg-based foods. I don't just randomly think about food at all. I mean, not any more then regular people do. Like, sometimes you're like 'I could really go for a good sandwich' but it's not - I mean, I certainly don't have any weird food-related like, [i]stuff,[/i] or anything."

"Really."

So this is going well.

"I mean, despite whatever you may have seen while looking through the closets earlier. I mean, like, um, I really don't even know why that costume is here and..."

And precisely none of this is getting a response out of Kendra. Bina gives up, and sighs. 

"So you having any luck?"

[k]"I think - just maybe - yeah. Christ."[/k]

"What?"

[k]"Dammit!"[/k]

"What!?"

[k]"Twelve was right. They actually are [i]welded[/i] in there. If I go in through the back with the torch it'll crack, or I'll melt one of the beams or - crap, crap, crap!"[/k]

"Uh..."

[k]"Whatever Three was up too when she made these things, she really didn't want anyone to mess with them."[/k]
