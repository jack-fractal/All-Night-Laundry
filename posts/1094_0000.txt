"Let's follow those handprints!"

[k]"Sorry, that was loud,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"Emmie? Where are the generators?"[/k]

"Uhh..." says Emmie. "All the way down the hall and 'round the corner. They're practically on the other side of the building."

[e]"Do you know where those handprints lead?"[/e]

"No, I mean - look. I've been down here maybe [i]twice[/i] in the three years I've worked here? It could be storage, or maybe biohazard disposal?"

[k]"OK, you lot go that way. I'll just grab my sister and meet up with you."[/k]

>>>NOTES:

So the ads are gone, that's good. It looks like they're some new feature that Disqus is calling "Reveal" which is apparently their code-word for "Click Bait Article Blob".

They sent me an e-mail when they activated it, but judging by the e-mail, they just straight up turned it on without my permission. So [i]that's[/i] great.
