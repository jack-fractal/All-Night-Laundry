"Wait, AMIE!?"

[k]"Yeah, about that... You... don't know about that whole thing."[/k]

"What whole thing?"

Kendra is suddenly being very cagey.

[k]"Your room-mate sort of..."[/k]

"What did she do?" growls Bina. 

[k]"She, kind of, sort of, maybe followed us... through... you know... tiiiime?"[/k]

"She WHAT!?"

"So who are we talking about?" asks Melissa.

[k]"Uh - nothing - nobody, I mean."[/k]

"Riiiiight, sure. Park your butt in here kid and we can take a look at those knees. Mind your IV line, getting a needle into your tiny veins was tough enough the first time."

Bina, choking on more questions, acquiesces.

Merci!

[quote=Dave]Any way we can help? Some of us may or may not have some amount of prior experience making websites for comic purposes.[/quote]

Hi Dave! 

I am really hesitant to accept offers like this, as generous and amazing as they are. The reasons for this are many but it's mostly because All Night Laundry has a bunch of rather weird technical requirements, like the split timelines, which require some complicated cookie and database shenanigans. In addition to that, I intend on building a bunch of other features into the site, like a blog and some other things in the future. This means that it would not be a one-time task, it would be an ongoing thing and that's not something I feel like I can ask of a volunteer.

I also [i]really want[/i] to do this myself. I've been trying to do it for, like, [i]years[/i] at this point, and it's become one of those personal victory things. I [i]think[/i] I finally have all the pieces in various places that I can actually do this thing at this point. 

That being said, offers of help are always super welcome and are really really cool. Thank you.
