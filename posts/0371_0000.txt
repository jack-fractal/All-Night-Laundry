The mud sucks. It is like walking in the world largest and smelliest slurpee machine. There's more of it too, the rain hasn't let up, and it doesn't look like this place has proper drainage.

[quote="tronn"]>Bina: Ask Kendra more about the 'weird piece of wood'. Did she see the cracks in time as something different too?[/quote]

"So hey, you saw it as a piece of wood?"

[k]"Yeah, like a piece of plywood. Old chipped paint on one side, faded. Covered in splinters. Holes where termites had eaten into it. Not something you'd want to hold on to."[/k]

"Huh. Weird."

[k]"Well what do [i]you[/i] see it as?"[/k]

"Like... a broken piece of window glass. Lots of little cracks."

[quote="wolftamer9"]> Um, if it's in the mud, isn't there a very decent chance of getting cut by it?[/quote]

[k]"So either way it could cut us."[/k]

"Uh, yeah. That... would probably not be great if that happened."

[k]"You don't say?"[/k]

"It should be around here somewhere. Near the mouth of the tunnel."

[k]"OK, I'll look for it. You go see if you can get us something to use as a walking stick from that pile of junk over there."[/k]
