She does not. In the absence of the traditional option, she grabs the closest heavy thing that it looks like she can lift. It turns out to be a... soooomething? A cash register? What is a cash register doing down here? Whatever! She tosses it through the nearest window.

The breaking glass sounds incredibly loud in the unnatural stillness of the drowning factory.

The noise appears to be enough to wake Horatio from whatever existential crisis had him dithering about at the bottom of the stairs. 

He begins to climb the stairs. He does this in the same way that he does everything else, which is to say [i]horribly[/i], and with a maximum amount of twitching and groaning.
