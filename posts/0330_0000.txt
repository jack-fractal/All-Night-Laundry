"Hey..."

[color=#C10087]"Um, wow. You almost knocked my glasses off."[/color]

"Sorry about that."

[color=#C10087]"I'm not complaining. Can we do that again? I mean, do you want too?"[/color]

"Yes! I mean, I really want too, but uuuurgh..."

[color=#C10087]"What? Did I - did I do something wrong?"[/color]

"No! No no no. You are wonderful, and the kiss was wonderful, and we are going to do a LOT more kissing in the future, do not worry on [i]that[/i] account, it's just... my dog is barking."

[color=#C10087]"So? She barks a lot. She is a barky kind of dog."[/color]

"I know, but this is a dream, and I'm kind of in the middle of being chased by a giant undead dream time dog."

[color=#C10087]"Giant undead dream time dog?"[/color]

"It's complicated."

[color=#C10087]"I bet."[/color]

"And Piotyr freaking out means that its prooobably found a way into this memory."

[color=#C10087]"It does?"[/color]

"Uh huh."

[color=#C10087]"That sucks! We're kind of in the middle of something here."[/color]

"I know! I was hoping it wouldn't be able to follow me here. Last time it had to do something complicated with a story-within-a-story kind of deal, just to get close to me. This time, apparently not."

[color=#C10087]"It has your scent now."[/color]

"Sounds like something like that."

[color=#C10087]"If this is a dream, can't you just wake up?"[/color]

"Maybe, but then what happens to Piotyr? She's my dog. She's living in my head! I can't leave her in here with a monster chasing her. I have to find her somewhere safe."

[color=#C10087]"Where? You just said the time-dog-thing knows how to follow you."[/color]

"I don't know!"

[color=#C10087]"We'll you'd better figure it out pretty quick."[/color]

"Why?"

[color=#C10087]"Because I just heard what sounded like a truly expensive amount of breaking glass."[/color]
