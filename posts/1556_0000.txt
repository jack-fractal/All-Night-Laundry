Hey everyone! Just letting you know, I have caught the sick again, so things will probably be pretty short for the next few days.

[quote="Miyo"]Oh no. I caught up. I only started 5 days ago.[/quote]

Hi Miyo! Welcome to the PTP! Glad you caught up. :)

[quote="Urmmux"]I did it! Took me a week but I did it. Another reader at PTP![/quote]

Hi Urmmux! A week is pretty good time! Thank you so much for reading.
