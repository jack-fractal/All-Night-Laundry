[quote="Blue"]>Did you actually mentioned the itching to anyone, before this moment? If not, there's probably going to be some awkward questions.[/quote]

"That's... good, right?" asks Amie, looking back and forth between Kendra and Bina. They seem to be treating this very seriously. "That means it's healing."

"Errr..." says Bina.

[k]"Oh [i]crap[/i],"[/k] says Kendra, picking up on Bina's tone of voice. [k]"Was it itching [i]earlier?"[/i][/k]

"Yeeeeaah."

[k][i]"When?"[/i][/k]

"Before [i]things[/i] happen."

"Weee... might be in trouble here."

[quote="badatnames"]>Kendra: Explain why this is a bad thing.[/quote]

[k]"Crap,"[/k] says Kendra. She looks at the two police officers drinking coffee and trying to act as though they're not listening. She asks [k]"You two have [i]guns[/i],right?"[/k]
