"Or maybe," says Bina, creeping back to peer around the humming generator again. "Maybe her loop got reset because it [i]was[/i] working."

[k]"And I am now realizing that this is not actually a control panel."[/k]

"What?"

[k]"It's just fuel levels and pressure gauges,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"Display only, no input."[/k]

[k]"Yes."[/k]

"Dammit!"

[k]"We can still shut them down manually,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"I think... probably."[/k]

"One at a time..." says Bina.
