[k]"Holy heck, you weren't kidding about the dog. Is she -"[/k]

"Stuck? Yeah."

"Lets not go near her," says Bina. "Ever."

[k]"That's seems like the best plan,"[/k] says Kendra.

The enormous animal strains forward, not thrashing as before, just a constant straining reach. It's no use though, as it doesn't seem able to move it's left front leg.

[i]'I'm in shock, right?'[/i] thinks Bina. [i]'I should be in shock. A normal person would be in shock right now.'[/i]

[k]"Is there a portal out there too?"[/k] asks Kendra.

"I don't think so," says Bina. "It's more like she rebuilds herself out of the mud."

[k]"Huh."[/k]

"Yep."

There's a pause while they both stare at the dog. 

[quote="Almonihah"]How's closing that portal coming?[/quote]

[k]"We should probably turn off the time machine, you think?"[/k]

"Yes! Lets do that!"
