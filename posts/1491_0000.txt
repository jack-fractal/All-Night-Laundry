[quote="Syndix"]Holy crap I finally caught up! I don't know what to do with my life now :) Patiently wait for updates I guess? Anyway... Keep up the good work!!! I usually avoid time travel stories cause they get monotonous/repetitive but this has kept my interest this whole time so!!! I'm excited :)[/quote]

Hi Syndix! Welcome to the Primary Temporal Position! 

I count myself as very picky about my time travel stories. I think, as a rule, I prefer time travel stories that basically just use time travel to frame another adventure (ALA Dr. Who) rather then stories like this one where the story is [i]about[/i] the time travel.

I added the time travel to this story largely as a result of suggestions.

Oh! There we go, that's another idea for what you can do, you can make suggestions!

Thank you for reading!
