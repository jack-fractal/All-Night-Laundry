It's several minutes later.

"Just sit there and don't move."

"Like, at all?"

"At all! You should still be in bed. Heck, you [i]should[/i] be dead, with how high that fever got. Kendra, towels [i]now[/i], she's [i]damp[/i]. You let someone recovering from a major fever get [i]damp[/i]."

[k]"That [i]is[/i] what rain does Mel,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"It's known for it."[/k]

"Towels! Now!"

[k]"On it."[/k]

"And you managed to do this to yourself how?" she asks Bina.

"I stepped on a tooth."

"A what?"

"A tooth. Like this."

Bina shows her the tooth. 

"Jesus, is that from a fricking dinosaur?" says Melissa, suitably impressed. "You are an injury magnet."

"Hey!"

"Tell me I'm wrong."

"It was a dog!"

[k]"Mel, your bedside manner is [i]awful[/i],"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"Also, here are the towels.""[/k]

"Dry her hair - and for your information, my patients are unconscious when I meet them," says Melissa. "Bedside manners are for people who are awake, and for people who don't step on dinosaur teeth after just getting up from a near lethal illness."

"It was a dog - Kendra, have you told her what's going on yet?"

"Stay still," says Melissa.

"I am!"

[k]"When, exactly, would I have had time to tell her what's going on?"[/k]

"That... is a valid point."

"I think the fact that I'm not actually shaking answers out of the both of you right now should get me a goddam medal," says Melissa. "Hand me that tape - no, not that one the [i]tape[/i] - yes - what was I saying... right! - In the last two hours, I've had a gun pointed at me, I nearly got eaten by zombies, and then, just to make things even better, my idiot sister decides to just jump out of the goddam building and [i]disappear[/i] for half an hour."

[k]"It was fifteen minutes, and I was pushed."[/k]

"That makes it [i]better!?[/i]"

[k]"I think a little, yeah."[/k]

"Bina!" says Amie, from the hall. "I found you shoes!"
