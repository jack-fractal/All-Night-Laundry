She does, until she runs out of away.

"Kendra!"

There's no way she'll be able to hear -

[k]"Bina! We have to get out of here!"[/k]

"I know! You think I don't know that?!" Her voice, when she hears it, is tinny, far away even inside her own head. 

Her mouth tastes strange around her words, and as she breathes in she realizes that the [i]smell[/i] is back. It's not the burned meat and sugar smell of the mud, it's the [i]other[/i] smell, the one that follows the undog around, the one that the Naughts all seem to reek of. 

The smell is ozone and brick dust, coppery and hot and something that reminds her of electrical transformers and high-tension powerlines. She's pretty sure she knows what the smell is now, it's the smell that time makes when it dies. 

"The Moment! Now! It's the only way!"

[k]"If you think I'm leaving you here, you've got another thing coming!"[/k]

"You won't have too."

[k]"Can you get across?"[/k] Kendra sounds doubtful. Bina wonders, for a second, how she is seeing all this. 

"No," she gasps. When did she get so out of breath? "But I have an idea!"

And if she's lucky, it might even work...
