It is [i]so good[/i]! You have no idea.

She doesn't feel [i]great[/i] by any stretch of the imagination. Her chest still feels like someone took a meat tenderizer to it, and her knees feel hot and, as some careful exploration revealed, are still very tender. 

But she doesn't feel like she's going to [i]die[/i] any more. That's the important thing.
