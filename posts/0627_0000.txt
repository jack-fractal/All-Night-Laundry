It is [i]so good[/i]! You have no idea.

[quote="wolftamer9"]> How do you feel? Do you think you can walk around on your own, or do you need to wait for Kendra?[/quote]

She doesn't feel [i]great[/i] by any stretch of the imagination. Her chest still feels like someone took a meat tenderizer to it, and her knees feel hot and, as some careful exploration revealed, are still very tender. 

But she doesn't feel like she's going to [i]die[/i] any more. That's the important thing.
