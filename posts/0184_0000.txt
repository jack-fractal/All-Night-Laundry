[quote="Lacemaker"]Bina, there is green emanating from your right hand. I think it's reacting to the envelope, and that is what has Kendra so freaked out.[/quote]

What! Oh crap. Bandages! Slipping!?

Wait, no. Her hands fine. No green glowing anything. It is itchy though. Her various other complaints, mainly her bladder, had been drowning that out until she thought about it. 

Better hurry up. There's definitely creaking noises now!

[quote="tegerioreo"]Don't get distracted.  Continue your Very Important Task until that envelope is completely open and you have identified its contents.[/quote]

No time for distractions!

Aaaand envelope open!

Come ooooonnn handcuff keys.
