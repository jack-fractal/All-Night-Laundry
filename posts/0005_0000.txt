Bita is startled but barely manages not to freak out. 

Danged hair, her elastic broke today too, at work, and she forgot to pick up another one at home before heading out again with the laundry. She shoves it back behind her ear. Maybe she should finally cut it. 

It's cloth, whatever it is she tripped over, so it's not going to hurt her.

Definitely for the best. She's just getting jumpy. She steps around the thing on the floor and flips the light on.

Hurray for light!

Turns out, the backup text copy for this was in post four, the previous one, so all restored properly now. Hurrah.
