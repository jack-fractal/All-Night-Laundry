[quote=tegerioreo;7903259]Bina:  Stay in bed.

Bina:  Demand that Kendra fill you in on everything that happened while you were un- and semi-conscious.[/quote]

After Melissa has left, Bina turns to Kendra and asks, "OK, what the heck [i]happened[/i] while I was out?"

Kendra explains about the long conversation she had with Elizabeth and about Phenomenology people she appears to be working for.

"So, they're like the X-Files?"

[k]"Yes! Exactly like that. In fact, if we meet her again, you should describe them in [i]precisely[/i] that way so that she knows you're up to speed."[/k]

"All right."

Bina listens as Kendra explains about wrangling the large time machine up the stairs and onto the street with a confused and complaining Elizabeth in tow.

"Wait, why did you need the time machine?"

[k]"Do you remember that I had you set our exit time from the Moment to [i]our[/i] primary temporal position? 2:30pm?"[/k]

"Vaaaaaaguely, I was sort of in the middle of passing out at that point. Why did you do that again? I can't remember."

[k]"Well, Elizabeth was still on a jump. If we [i]stayed[/i] in our time, Elizabeth would have snapped back to the point at which she fell, and I was pretty sure she'd [i]also[/i] snap back to the [i]place[/i] in which she fell which would-"[/k]

"- be spectacularly lethal."

[k]"Yes."[/k]

"Why not just have me point the [i]Moment[/i] back to 8:30 am? This whole thing with the time machine seems super elaborate."

[k]"I thought we'd need it later. The Moment creates entropy when used as a time machine. I think [i]all[/i] the time machines do. I don't think the other Bina's cared much about that, because they had, like, an entire universe to burn, but we're almost out of space in there."[/k]

"Oooooh, right."

[k]"I thought the hassle was worth having a few extra days."[/k]

"OK, OK, keep going."

Kendra continues and gets to the part with Amie.

"Wait, she [i]actually has[/i] blue hair? That wasn't a crazy dream?"

[k]"She [i]jumped through time[/i] with us and [i]this[/i] is what you care about?"[/k]

"Well it's a really big thing for her."
