[quote=Alcastar;7794145]The joke is that in the Japanese version of the anime Stardust Crusaders, the character Joseph Joestar is American, and while he speaks in Japanese most of the show, he curses in English and it sounds hilariously out of place because he has a Japanese accent. The video is just pop culture references, pasted over Stardust Crusaders art. I think that's what it is, i'm not sure though. :mspa:[/quote]

Aaah... I am enlightened now. Very amusing. :mspa:

I have to watch this show now...
