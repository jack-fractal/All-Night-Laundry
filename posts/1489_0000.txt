"Amie, this is me, OK? Bina. Queen of Freaking Out. High Poobah of Anxiety Attacks that Fuck with Her Life. Am I freaking out right now?"

"No! But-"

"Is Kendra freaking out?"

"No?"

"No," repeats Bina. "'Cause we got this."

[k]"Right,"[/k] says Kendra [k]"But you might want to actually [i]do[/i] the thing because it's about to get out of visual range and then-"[/k]

"Yeah yeah, OK, I'm doing the thing. Amie? You gotta move a little."
