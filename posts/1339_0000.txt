"Why not?"

Oh right, yes, he's allowed to ask questions isn't he? Kendra hadn't thought that far ahead, beyond just telling him.

Being mean to Emmie would be a lot easier if he wasn't so pretty.

[k]"Because it's dangerous and - I can't ask you to do this and -"[/k]

[quote="Jon Stout"]> Emmie: "Tough shit. I'm coming anyway." Albeit put much more diplomatically.[/quote]

"You didn't."

[k]"What?"[/k]

People keep doing this to her. She's normally better at conversations then this. 

"You didn't ask."

She hadn't. Again.

"I offered, there is a difference."

[quote="xooxu"]Kendra: "Maybe, but the more you get involved with, the slimmer your chances of being able to run if you need to get."[/quote]

[k]"Emmie, you have no idea what you're walking into here. I know we told you some of it but the further you get into this -" [/k]

"Hey!" yells Bina. "Are you two planning on coming or what?"

[k]"Just a second!"[/k]

[quote="tegerioreo"]Whatever it is, take more than a second.

Amie: Point out this fact.[/quote]

"You said that like a whole minute ago!" says Amie. "I want to see the TARDIS! Do you realize what you're asking me to wait for here!?"

[k]"Just-"[/k]

"This is something I have wanted to do since I was [i]literally[/i] six years old!"

[k]"Just - one more second! Jeeze!"[/k]

Kendra inhails through her nose and turns to Emmie.

[k]"Look - Emmie. I don't want you to get hurt."[/k]

"Me neither," he says. "I'm very attached to being alive, it's way up there in my list of favorite things about myself, but tell me the truth, could I be useful?"

[k]"I don't-"[/k]

"If you say no, if you think I'll be in the way, I'll stay here, but if I can help..."

"Seriously!" yells Amie. "Can we get this show on the road please?"

[k]"Yes!"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"OK - yes! We're both coming."[/k]
