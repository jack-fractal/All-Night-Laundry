[quote="Oranckers"]Found this a few days ago and finally caught up. This adventure is awesome and I loved every second of it. I do however have one question for you: if Elizabeth works for the government, why doesn't she use a Blackberry?[/quote]

Hi Oranckers! Glad you enjoyed yourself! 

I could come up with a clever answer, but basically... I didn't really think about it. 

I hope you stick around and make suggestions! :)
