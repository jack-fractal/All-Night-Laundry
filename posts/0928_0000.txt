[quote=KÃ­eros;7873062]> I think that since Elizabeth is in a more urgent situation, go to her temporal thingy rather than yours.[/quote]

[quote=Dave]Bina is in bad shape, but she's not at risk of dying. I mean, not immediately. If she's going to keel over, it'll be from infection (or time woo-woo) and that's not going to kill her [i]now[/i]. Elizabeth, on the other hand, has a massive head wound and possibly more trauma we're not even aware of. She could be dying [i]right now[/i].

What happens if you all jump backward to Elizabeth's primary temporal position? Will that be the same as her going back, or will she be on some kind of double-jump? You could jump back, get her taken care of, then return forward yourselves.[/quote]

"I think we should go when Elizabeth is. That'll cancel her jump and we can... I mean after, we can do stuff."

[k]"You're sick Bina. [i]Really[/i] sick. How are your knees?"[/k]

"They're kinda eurgggh...?"

[k]"Precisely."[/k]

"But I'm not as bad as [i]she[/i] is. I know I can - look - I don't wanna argue Kendra..."

[k]"I know, I'm sorry. OK, we'll... we'll help Elizabeth first OK? I promise."[/k]

[k]"Ours."[/k]

"What?"

[k]"Set it to ours and we need somewhere private. Somewhere bigger than those bathrooms. With power."[/k]

"Like what? We can't use the house, someone lives in it in the real world."

[k]"Hmm.... OK, but you live nearby, right? Can we reach your apartment?"[/k]

"Well... yeah, but-"

[k]"OK, so set it to [i]our[/i] primary temporal position, 2:25 pm, in your apartment."[/k]

"But if we go to [i]our[/i] time... we're running out of hours Kendra. The Botfly always resets the loop before the end of the day on the 17th. If we spend too much of our time at a hospital or something, or if the time machine down in the factory breaks and Elizabeth vanishes during surgery or we-"

[k]"Let me worry about all that. You just set the output vector and I will handle it, ok? Once you're done with that you can sleep for a bit, I don't - Elizabeth isn't going to die in the next little while."[/k]

Bina looks like she wants to keep arguing, but after a few moments of hesitation she sighs and starts typing.
