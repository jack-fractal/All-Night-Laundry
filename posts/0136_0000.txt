No time for that. The box of bodybags goes back on the pile of stuff.

It would take too long to put one on now, but she picks up one of the filter masks. 

She really hopes she can get out of here quickly, but if she ends up in a situation where she needs a gasmask she's probably going to REALLY need a gasmask.
