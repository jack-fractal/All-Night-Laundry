Hmm... maybe she could just...

But no. They might not even notice if she did that. If nobody used the computer then nothing would change.

Go big or go home.

You might think you do something to save her, but how do you know what you're doing wasn't meant to happen? What if your message will be the one to send Hyung into Gregor's arms?

Bina's got no answer for this one. You might be right.

And if her actions are what causes the events that cause her to then take those actions, that means that the snake bites its own tail. Everything is predestined and if she ever ends up in this situation again she'll know she can do whatever she likes, as none of it will have any effect.

But she doesn't think that's the case. Her conversation with Josephine was interrupted. Something [i]intervened[/i] there. Something pushed her out. There'd be no need to do that if her presence couldn't affect anything.

Then there was the business with the writing on the door.

"What kind of maggot grows in the corpse of a day?"

Whenever she thinks about that her head hurts and her eyes water.

What kind of maggot grows in the corpse of a day?

The letters weren't there.

But they were. 

Both versions of opening that door are inside her head, but they're in the same spot.

OK.

OK. 

Painting it is then.
