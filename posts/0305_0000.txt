It totally WAS her fault!

I mean, by the next night I'd pretty much forgotten the whole thing. I'd never been to a summer-camp like this before and everything was new and exciting. I was so busy doing stuff, I didn't have [i]time[/i] to worry about being away from home, or that I didn't know anyone here, let alone Sam's weird... stuff.

So when Sam marched up to me at dinner and asked me if I had a flashlight, I was confused.

"Um, yeah," I answered, "It was in the list of stuff you're supposed to bring to camp. Like, eight t-shirts, long pants, suntan lotion, bathing suit, socks, flashlight, and some other stuff. Did you forget yours? I can let you borrow mine if you want."

[color=#A62A00]"No, I have my own, I was just checking for later. You might wanna save some of that food, and maybe grab a bottle of water, just in case."[/color]

"Later?" I really [i]had[/i] forgotten. I thought she maybe meant for like, going to the bathroom or something.

[color=#A62A00]"For the [i]mission[/i]. You know? To the [i]bakery[/i]."[/color]

"You - you're actually going to [i]do[/i] that?"

[color=#A62A00]"[i]WE'RE[/i] going to do it,"[/color] she said, putting extra emphasis on the 'we', [color=#A62A00]"And what do you mean 'actually going to', of COURSE we're going to do it!"[/color]

"Oh," I said, "Right. Yeah. Of course."

And so we did.
