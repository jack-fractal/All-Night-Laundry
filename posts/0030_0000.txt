She stands up and her hair falls in front of her face again. She is getting so sick of not having a - wait is this the terrible bench-thing from the laundry? How weird.

She stands up, steps forward, and stops.

Both people are staring at her.

After a few seconds the man leans forward and asks in a hoarse whisper her how it is that she is do this? 

Did he not get her too? Did he not show her?

Woo! Thirty updates!

I reeeally wasn't digging the design on our new friend here. She looked waaaay to much like Bina.
