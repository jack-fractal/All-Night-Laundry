"Err... were you... you know, being serious just now?"

"What?"

"About killing time?"

"Ah! No, not [i]now[/i] of course. I don't think the dead get to affect the living that directly."

"Oh," I try to think of something clever to say. I come up with, "Good."

"While I was alive, of course, that's another story."

"Uhh..."

"Have you not figured out what's going on yet?"

[quote="a52"]Also Jack, the panels we see are 800 * 600, but what resolution do you draw them at? Do you draw them larger then shrink them down or do you just draw them at 800*600?[/quote]

I draw everything at 800x600. I started with that ratio and dammit I'm going to finish with that ratio! :)

But yeah, I draw at full res, not 2x or what'evs. I probably [i]should[/i] draw at 2x, but this works, and it's less pixels to cover.
