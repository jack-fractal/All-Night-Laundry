It's so bright.

"You get used to it."

Doesn't it hurt your eyes?

[quote="rachelcp"]Wake UP!
 I'm not sure if it works here but in Real life your breathing in dreams is virtually always linked to the breathing of your actual self pinch your nose you'll either find out hey I can breath through my nose even while it's blocked and it'll unfortunately do nothing or you'll move your arm in real life and wake yourself up or the realization of it will wake you up. if it's the first then purposely start breathing abnormally if still nothing try anything just WAKE UP.[/quote]

>>>NOTES:

Day 1000, here we are.

First off, the contest. As of this post, entries are officially closed. I'll roll the dice tomorrow to select a winner.

I did not expect to reach this point, I started numbering my images with four digits sort of as a joke ("Ha ha! Look how much I'm worrying about naming conventions even for my own short little project!") but now that I'm here, it feels pretty good. I was considering writing a big thing, but I'll save that for another time.

Thank you everyone who has read or commented, or both. Thank you for coming on this strange, strange journey with me. We're not done yet, but we're getting there.
