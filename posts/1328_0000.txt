[quote="Asthanius"]Kendra: Explain that Mel completely misunderstands the situation. You and Bina are protecting each other from someone else.[/quote]

[k]"Jesus Mel..."[/k]

[quote="tegerioreo"]Sure you can. A medical professional should know that.[/quote]

[k]"OK - first you're wrong and you know you're wrong, and second Bina is not suicidal."[/k]

"I didn't say she was!"

[k]"Don't pull that shit Mel, [i]please[/i].[/k]

"I'm not!"

[k]"Mel, I don't have time for this. We are, [i]literally[/i], on a clock. Bina has an issue with not paying enough attention to her personal safety, and you're right, that is something that I'm going to bring up with her and she needs to work on, but you're misreading this situation [i]extremely badly[/i] if you think [i]that[/i] is the main problem here."[/k]

"I didn't mean it like that - I just -"

[quote="Unclever title"]"We're fighting against a prescient telepathic wish alien, an undead dog giant, some russian dude and zombies. Not an addiction."[/quote]

[quote="Breadproduct"]>She is worried about you. Don't be too harsh on her.[/quote]

[k]"I know, OK? I know you don't want me to get hurt but [i]zombies and aliens.[/i] Keep that in mind. You didn't imagine it. It wasn't a hallucination. What happened in the basement [i]happened[/i]. It's not in our heads. Zombies and aliens. [i]That's[/i] what we're dealing with."[/k]

To which, Melissa has no reply.

[k]"I have to get cheese."[/k]
