Bina can speak french fairly well. Not GREAT, but well enough to read a newspaper or work in a restaurant in a city full of french speakers.

[quote="Wessolf27"]Bina: Realize that attempting to explain this to her might end up with her disbeliving you. Tell her that you had fallen and gashed your arm on a couple of spikes(?).[/quote]

A ton of possible options rush through her mind. 

This woman doesn't seem in the know about the whole TV-What-Eats-You, and talking about laundromats and skeleton dogs might make her think she's crazy. 

She tries to start with the old classic of "Hold on, I can explain everything" when she realizes, slightly too late, that her mouth is still full of tangerine.

She promptly almost chokes to death.

Hurray! First impressions! She is making them.

She swallows the rest of the tangerine.

Despite what just happened, Bina agrees entirely.
