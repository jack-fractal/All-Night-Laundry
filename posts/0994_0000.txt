Yes. 

That's right. I'm so tired. 

I can't sleep yet. I - I have things I need to do. People are counting on me.

[quote="BreadProduct"]>What's troubling you?[/quote]

I've messed up so much. I keep trying, but I never know if I'm doing the right thing. What if the best thing to do was just...

Why is it so hot in here?

"Pumpkin? Are you all right?"

Lash?

"You're a million miles away."

Something's wrong. This my apartment, the one in Montreal. Lash has never been here before...

What's going on? When is this?

"It's next month, remember?"

Next... month?

"You're thinking of asking me to come visit you once your summer classes are finished. You haven't done it yet, but I know you're thinking of doing it. I think you're scared I'll say no."

That's right... I - I remember now. On Skype.

I was going to - but - you're wrong about me being scared. I am scared, yeah, I'm scared you'll say no, but I'm more scared you'll say [i]yes[/i].

"You're not eating Bina. You need to eat."
