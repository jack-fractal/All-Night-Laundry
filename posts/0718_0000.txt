The slithery, grainy feeling is still there, but muffled. Quieter.

[size=10][k]"Did you ever figure out who wrote that ominous question over there? It is waaaay creepier then you described it, by the way."[/k]

"I think [i]I[/i] did it."

[k]"You mean before-you? B12?"[/k]

"No, I asked her. She had no idea what it meant. Another me. B3 maybe? Or this-me, only later. Might be [i]you[/i] now I think about it. Does it sound like the kind of thing that you'd do?"

[k]"Not so much! This kind of time travel is less fun than it looks on TV."[/k]

"How long do you think until the Naughts exist?"

[k]"Maybe a minute? Two, if we're lucky."[/k]

"Dammit! We can't look through all this stuff in two minutes!"
