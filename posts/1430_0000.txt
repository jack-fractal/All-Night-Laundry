>>>NOTES:

Hey everyone! We're on to another scene now, but yes! Our intreped photocopy quasi-thieves will be getting swanky new gear.

Do you want to help design them? I hope you do because when everyone helped me come up with clothes for Bina they were the best clothes in the entire comic! Unlike last time, you have about three days to come up with your designs 'cause Bina and Kendra are doing their thing.

THINGS TO REMEMBER IF YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT AN OUTFIT!

	1. The temperature in the moment is a cool summer morning, but everyone knows they're going back out into the real world soon, and Montreal is cold as an autumn day, the area near the Laundromat is even colder, and the area down in the pit is even colder. They'll probably dress in layers.
	
	2. Ridiculous things will not be worn, but may be mentioned. 
	
	3. Amie tends to wear jackets, jeans, and sneakers, while Emmie tends to wear sweaters, dress shoes, and slacks.

You're all the best! Thanks!
