[k]"I don't know!"[/k] says Kendra, [k]"But it [i]is[/i] doing [i]this[/i]!"[/k]

"Is it supposed to do that?"

[k]"I have no idea!"[/k]

"OK!" says Bina, "OK! Do the thing. Do the thing!"

[k]"The thing?"[/k]

"The whatever-you-do-to-make-the-time-travel-happen thing!"

[k]"Shine the danged light on the shard then!"[/k]

Bina does. Kendra touches the targeting wire to the conductive plate. 

The shard of time clouds over, turns black, and begins to hum.

"Is it supposed to do [i]that[/i]?"

[k]"Yes! I think so."[/k] says Kendra. [k]"OK. OK! Now I just have to adjust the amount of electricity going through it until we find the weak spot."[/k]

"[i]The[/i] weak spot?" asks Bina, emphasizing the first word. "Which one are you aiming for?"

[k]"The one from just before when we met. The one that messed up your voice. It [i]should[/i] be the second-to-last one. That'll give us plenty of time, and we know where Gregor is then, he's taking you to the basement so..."[/k]

"Err... ok. How will we know when it's working?"

[k]"The journal said we'd [i]feel[/i] it. I thought she meant, like, intuition or something, but she has to have been talking about the vibration. I bet the vibration changes based on targeting proximity - Argh! This is what the acoustic chambers are for!"[/k] Kendra smacks herself in the forehead with the heel of her hand. 

At Bina's confused expression she elaborates, [k]"Some of the other designs have these acoustic boxes right under the shard socket, but I couldn't figure out what the point of them was. Heck, if you knew the pitch for the different weak spots you could make a kind of automatic targeting system if you had some audio softw- [/k]

"Not to hurry you along or anything, I know this is really cool, but I think we're about to have company!" says Bina. "Can we make with the time travel already?"

[k]"I can certainly try."[/k]

Outside the truck there are familiar gasping moans.

"TRY FASTER!"
