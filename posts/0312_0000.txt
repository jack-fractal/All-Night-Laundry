[quote="xooxu"]>So, did you ever figure out why the buildings were so weird? Why were they just plopped down in the middle of nowhere?[/quote]

No, I didn't even look it up. Considering how the whole ordeal turned out, Sam and I agreed never to speak of it again. 

Of course, Sam was now in the middle of ruining that agreement, but I had been trying to forget it.

It was embarassing. We'd gotten so scared by the police that we'd both made fools of ourselves. I am expecting Sam to downplay her own screams and running and emphasize my own. She'd been successful at least, she got away. I was the one who ended up getting arrested.

I wasn't looking forward to Lash hearing about that.

[quote="ArcusofBrambles"]> WHAT WAS THAT!?[/quote]

"Did you hear that?" 

I had heard the voices again.

[color=#A62A00]"No,"[/color] said Sam, dropping the ledger, [color=#A62A00]"There's nobody here. You're probably hearing a bat or something. You're not scared of [i]bats[/i] are you?"[/color]

"There aren't any bats. There isn't any anything in here except us. That's really weird."

[color=#A62A00]"Precisely! So there can't be any voices."[/color]

Sam was entirely wrong about this. 

[color=#A62A00]"Lets go find the oven,"[/color] said Sam, [color=#A62A00]"It'll probably be upstairs, on the first floor."[/color]

"I guess."

[color=#A62A00]"I wanna stick my head in it,"[/color] said Sam, starting to walk down the hallway, [color=#A62A00]"You gotta take the picture. When I do. It'll be awesome. Nobody will [i]believe[/i] it."[/color]

"OK," I said. Maybe if we got the pictures then we could leave.

[color=#A62A00]"Come on Bina! Don't be a wuss!"[/color] said Sam, recognizing my lack of interest at last, [color=#A62A00]"There's nothing there."[/color]

"I know." I said. But still... I was sure I'd heard something. Two voices. They'd sounded like they were having an argument. 

[quote="xooxu"]>Obviously move your flashlight a little to the left to see the crazy killer standing there.[/quote]

So I swung the beam of my flashlight towards where the sounds had been coming from.

But of course, there was nothing there.

"Right," I said, turning to follow Sam. "Nothing there. Lets go."

[color=#A62A00]"See? I told you."[/color]
