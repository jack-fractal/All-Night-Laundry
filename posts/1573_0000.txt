"Especially not when it's half finished already."

[k]"Yeah, good idea on checking the Viewer code."[/k]

>>>NOTES:

Hey everyone! The ads are not me. It's Disqus activating them against my continuously expressed desire to not have ads. I've deactivated them again, and now it appears that I'll have to pay ten dollars a month to not inflict ads on everyone, but they're still showing up. 

I admit myself mildly vexed.
