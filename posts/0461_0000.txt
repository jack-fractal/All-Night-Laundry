"OK, so how are we going to swing this thing?"

[k]"We have to shift our weight back and forth, so, I guess we lean on one rail, then the other rail and see what happens."[/k]

"Wait!"

[k]"What?"[/k]

"I just had a thingy!"

[k]"What thingy?[/k]

[quote=TheBurningFox;7649291]> Plan: Formulate.[/quote]

"An idea thingy! What about those?"

[k]"What about what?"[/k]

"Those!"

[k]"Bina, more then half the lights are out, I can't see what you're pointing at."[/k]

"Here, gimme the flashlight, I'll show you."

[k]"How 'bout [i]I[/i] hold the flashlight and [i]you[/i] just tell me where to point it."[/k]

"Hey!"

[k]"I'd rather not play around with any more of the green stuff unless we absolutely cannot avoid it."[/k]

"But the light only comes out green if I hold it in my right hand."

[k]"And how did you figure [i]that[/i] out?"[/k]

"By accident, mostly. I was sort of experimenting while you were taking your shower." 

[k]"Are you - I mean - are you doing it on purpose? The green thing? Like when you shawn the light on Gregor?"[/k]

"What!? No, it just happens."

[k]"Hmm. Only your right hand? Does that happen with [i]anything[/i] you're holding?"[/k]

"I dunno, maybe? I've seen it do weird stuff to computer screens and tv's, but I just tried it with the flashlights."

[k]"Well now [i]I'm[/i] the one with the weird idea."[/k]

"What?"

[quote=tegerioreo;7649392]WAIT!  Before you do that, just verify that the X-ray gun does not generate some kind of wacky thrust or a Green-rainbow Bridge or a pocket of Slowed-down Time when used in your botfly hand.[/quote]

[k]"Something about x-rays. Remind me about it later if we survive this. Where is this thing you're talking about?"[/k]

"There! See?"

[k]"Oooh ho. Yeeeah. I see what you're getting at. [i]That[/i] might work."[/k]

>>>NOTES:

What about the portable x-ray? They don't have it. It's still in the bio-tent. The one who saw it was [i]Kendra[/i] and up 'till now hadn't had the "light emitting objects in proximity to Bina's hand emit unlight" thing explained to her.
