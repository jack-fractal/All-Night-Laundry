[quote="Chaz Wallace"]side note: even if they have no clue, Amie seems like the type to ask a bit too loudly "what's Celadon Jungle?"[/quote]

"What's Celadon Jungle?" asks Amie, quite a bit too loud for Bina's taste, as they start climbing the small rise to the emergency entrance to the hospital.

[k]"Amie, shut up,"[/k] hisses Kendra.

"But what is it?" asks Amie, only a little quieter.

[k]"It's a code word,"[/k] says Kendra. 

"From the not-X-files people," says Bina. "I was checking if he was one of them. Which, he isn't. Which sucks 'cause that could have been useful."

[quote="Dave Rapp"]Clearly he's deflecting. He just wants us to leave. That means he must be in on it![/quote]

"He seems kinda evasive," says Amie, taking another look at the old man walking a little ways ahead of them and shooting concerned glances over his shoulder every few seconds. "Maybe he's hiding something! Maybe you didn't give like, a countersign or a hand signal!"

[quote="Dave Rapp"]Getting Bina's foot looked at should be priority two. Getting her some shoes to avoid further stepping-on-teeth injuries should be priority three. Priority one should be, and I can't believe I just thought of this, check up on Elizabeth.[/quote]

[k]"No,"[/k] says Kendra, simply. [k]"Come on, Bina's bleeding all over the place and I need to check on Mel and Emmie."[/k]

"And Elizabeth," says Bina.

[k]"Yeah,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"Jeeze, her too. God, can everyone just stay in one place and in one piece for like [i]ten minutes[/i]?"[/k]
