If it's any consolation, neato stories like this and a few others have inspired me to begin writing my own in my spare time. All will slowly be posted in the link within my signature. Anyway, keep up the great work and funny Bina faces, Jack! :pranky:[/quote]

Hey! Glad to hear that you're making your own stuff!

Bina makes lots of funny faces. It is one of my favorite parts about doing this whole thing. 

Thanks for reading!
