Bina waves her hand through the lights. They're so pretty. She wants to know what they feel like.

No! Bina! Don't touch it.

Her hand goes right through the bright thiny... things. 

They feel cold and hot at the same time! That's so neat. And sort of prickly. Like pins and needles.

Sort of like she imagined lightning would feel like. If you could feel lightning without dying. 

Funny! She can't feel her hand anymore. 

Ha. 

Ha.

Hah! Hah!

That's... not... really, that funny.
