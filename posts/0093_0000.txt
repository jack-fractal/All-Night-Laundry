She wants to run. Even the courtyard with the TV, and the wires, and strange dead air was better then this whirlwind.

[quote="epoxy"]> Make sure Piotr is with you.[/quote]

But she's not leaving the dog.

Bina lurches across the room toward Piotr, wind buffeting her almost off her feet. The woman, Josephine, clearly frightened, and [i]angry[/i] about being frightened, yells something at her that she can barely hear. It doesn't matter. Her meaning is clear enough.

What is [b]HAPPENING[/b]?

Bina wishes that she knew.

Her ears pop, then pop again, like on an airplane. An airplane with no engines, dropping like a stone. 

Through the flailing strands of her hair she sees something else, whirling, held aloft by the unnatural storm. 

Her grandmothers scarf. It feels the wind too.
