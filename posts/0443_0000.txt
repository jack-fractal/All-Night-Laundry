"I mean, when I saw this place before, I knew it was big. But this is ridiculous. It can't just be one factory. There's enough sugar equipment down here to give every child in the world [i]severe[/i] dental problems.!"

[k]"BINA!!!"[/k]

"What!?"

[quote=ArcusofBrambles;7638574]Kendra, try sitting down.  If you can't see the heights it might help a little, and you'll be more stable from that position.[/quote]

[quote=Viiranen;7639049]> Sit down, relax, minimize the chances of falling off.[/quote]

[quote=xooxu;7638995]>Both of you should sit down. It'll make it easier to keep your balance so the gondola doesn't swing. Plus Kendra probably won't be able to see down if she's sitting. So yay.[/quote]

[quote=Maltor][quote=Xander;7638743]Kendra: Sit down and look up.[/quote]
Slowly.[/quote]

[k]"Will you PLEASE sit DOWN!?"[/k]
