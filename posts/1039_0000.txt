"OK," says Melissa. "That's... OK." 

Emmit starts, "Is it-"

"All gone?" says Melissa, interrupting. "Looks like it."

"What!?" asks Bina. "Do I have another whatsit?"

"Uhh... no," says Emmie. "But you must tell me your diet and exercise plan. We could write a book and make [i]millions[/i]."

"These stitches are going to have to come out," says Melissa in a soft voice. "Already."

"When you came in, your knees were so swollen that, had you been wearing pants, we would have had to cut them off of you. Now, I don't see any inflammation at all."

"That's... good, right?" asks Bina.

"Yes!" says Emmie. "Very good!"

"And it shouldn't be [i]possible[/i]," says Melissa, as though Bina's recovery were some kind of personal insult.
