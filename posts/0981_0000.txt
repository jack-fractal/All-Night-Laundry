"Uhhh - you guys aren't like... Time Lords are you? Because if sooo... I don't think much of your TARDIS."

[k]"Hah,"[/k] says the one called Kendra, [k]"No. More's the pity. I would feel a hell of a lot less terrified about all this, if I had a few resurrections under my hat."[/k]

"Who [i]are[/i] you then?"

[k]"I'm a parking attendant and [i]she[/i] is an official government investigator of the scurrilous and spooky."[/k]

[e]"Gaaah... you can't just -"[/e]

"Scurrilous and spooky? Wait - "

[quote="a52"]>To Elizabeth: "So what, are you guys the X-Files or something?"[/quote]

[quote="2Cre@te"]Yes. Make this a thing.[/quote]

"- You mean [i]like the X-Files?![/i]"

[e]"Kill me now."[/e]

"Sorry."

[k]"It's OK. It's sort of a sore spot for her, but [i]yes[/i] like the X-Files, just Canadian and somewhat less reputable."[/k]

[e]"Hey!"[/e]

[quote=DS]> Um , wait, Bina? Hospital? You want some answers, now. Like, what the hell happened to your roommate?[/quote]

"You mentioned Bina, is she your friend? Is she uhh.. here?"

[k]"She's on the couch, but she's really out of it. I think I [i]may[/i] have overdone it on the painkillers."[/k]

Adler Young does his laundry while an off-model mini-Piyotr looks on:

[b]Enter me in that-there fan lottery.[/b][/quote]

Ha ha! This is so great! Poor Adler. He has a tough time.

I have also worked out what I'm going to do for the prize. There's only going to be one, but it's a pretty good one. 

The winner of the 1000th day fanart shenanigans will be given a copy of either:

1. Adobe Creative Cloud Single App (Photoshop, Illustrator, or Flash) - 1 Year Subscription
2. Clip Studio Paint Pro (Also known as Manga Studio)

Photoshop is the more expensive of the two by [i]far[/i], but Clip Studio is [i]awesome[/i] so I thought I'd include it.
