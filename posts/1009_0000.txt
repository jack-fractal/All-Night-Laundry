[quote="Xam"]Now for my first request to Bina....

Get dressed while keeping an cautious ear out for any strange noises. If anyone/anything comes in while changing, SCREAM![/quote]

Err... yeah, but she can't get that [i]super cool[/i] granny T-shirt on over the IV. 

How horrible. 

[quote="tegerioreo"]Put on all the clothing you can without unplugging your IV[/quote]

Bina acquires pants!

Hurray!

[quote="xooxu"]At least put on the underwear and the pants, if they fit. Then really you should be resting.[/quote]

And underwear!

And Hello Kitty socks!

So much better!

Eurgh, but her head is sort of spinny now. She feels like she would if she'd just ran for a good half hour and all she's done is put on some socks. Whatever happened to her, it's really kicked her endurance in the butt. 

[quote="xooxu"]You can try calling Amie again later? Did you call her cell phone, or your apartment?[/quote]

She called Amie's cellphone. Their apartment doesn't have a landline.

She really wants to just lay back down and sleep for the next forever, but she [i]should[/i] call Amie back, and she'll feel kinda dumb not at least [i]checking[/i] the door. 

Also there's the whole 'she doesn't know what time it is' thing. That's making her downright worried.
