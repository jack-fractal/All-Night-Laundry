[quote=Anthano]> Piotyr now would be a good time to leave the badsmell and go to dadsmell[/quote]

[quote="Corpseguide"]Piotyr, run back to pack leader the game is over[/quote]

And then something happens.

I am falling.

But also, I am not falling.

I am both things and I don't understand. 

I am falling AND not falling, and I am still here, in the digging place, with the bad smell in my nose, and in my mouth, and in my EVERYWHERE and something is very very wrong, and packleader is not here and I cannot FIND him and -

And I am distracted.

And confused.

And there is another wheel.
