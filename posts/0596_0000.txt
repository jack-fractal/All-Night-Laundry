I never did go forward to the cockpit. I just went back to my seat and apologized to... well, ok, to everyone. I apologized to Jessica the Flight Attendant, and to the lady who dropped her cocktail, and to the Air Marshal (I apologized to him a lot, he was very scary), and to Mr. Haddad, my seat-mate, who had to put up with me smelling slightly like vomit for another two hours, and just in general, to everyone. 

A lot.

I'm Canadian. It is in my nature.

Someone from the future maybe? But no, this place doesn't feel real. It doesn't feel [i]dead[/i] like the Factory did, just not real.

[quote="TobiasMoon"]This is certainly a lot better than some of the other possibilities, like being in a crashing plane.[/quote]

Yeah!

[quote="1412"]>Well this looks nice.[/quote]

It does...

Which makes me suspicious! 

Something horrible is [i]definitely[/i] going to jump out at me. 

[quote="wolftamer9"]> Oh shit. It's [u][i]her[/i][/u], isn't it? Oh shit.[/quote]

It better not be! 'Cause I am in nose-punch first, apologize later kind of mood right now. It wasn't a very good time in my life that I was just remembering and I am NOT IN THE MOOD for shenanigans.

The wind smells clean, and bright. No exhaust, but a hint of something... baking of some kind. Shortbread? 

Hmmm... the table is tempting, but - what exactly IS that?

It's clearly part of the construction, but it seems out of place. A six or seven meter high wall projecting right out of the deck. Almost featureless. 

Not exactly aerodynamic.

From behind the strange wall comes a bright pocking sound, then another almost immediately afterwards. 

Pock, pock!

There is a short pause, and then the sound repeats again. 

Pock, pock!

A pair. Or is it a trio?

Pock, p-pock!

A school-yard sound.

Old memories.

Familiar.
