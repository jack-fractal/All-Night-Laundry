[quote="TheHistoryBuff"]Aaaaah! I just caught up! Found this through an ad on another webcomic and haven't thought about much else until I got caught up. Simply fantastic, and the best way to spend the days leading up to graduation.[/quote]

Congratulations on your graduation! Glad you caught up. Stick around, we're about to hit four years. ;)
