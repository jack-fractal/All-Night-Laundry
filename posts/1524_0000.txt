They'd probably let her stay... but she doesn't want to cause any more trouble or attract any more attention. She decides to sit outside under the eaves. It's not raining much, and she'll be dry out here.

She sets her new friend down, careful not to let her fur get in any of the wet bits.

All right, she has her book, she has her fluffy new study partner. What's she forgetting?

Ah right. Yes, she has to make sure they don't tell her the code and make her brains explode all over the place.
