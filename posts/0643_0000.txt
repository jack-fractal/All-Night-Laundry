Bina watches while Kendra, with painful slowness, starts sliding the conductive wire up the length of blacked metal pinned to the device.

"Anything?" asks Bina. 

[k]"Not. Yet."[/k] says Kendra, through her teeth.

"OK, so, like, just so you know. They ARE inside, sort of, there's two of them trying to get through the window at once."

[k]"Will you be quiet for a minute!?"[/k]

"Sorry! You know, just keeping you up to date on our imminent demise."

[k]"You just make sure that you keep that light pointed in the right direction and [i]shh![/i]"[/k]

Bina manages this, heroically, for about five seconds.

"OK! So! The one with three heads just figured out how to get its shoulders through the doorway by sort of slipping [i]inside[/i] the other one's chest cavity. Which was, just, you know, [i]yuck![/i] So, do you mind me asking [i]what the heck is the hold up!?[/i]"

[k]"I can't find any weak spots!"[/k] says Kendra. She's starting to sound frantic. [k]"I think it maybe changed pitch a few times but just [i]barely[/i] I can't be sure if I'm really hearing it or if I'm just imagining it!"[/k] She pauses and swipes a hand across her face. [k]"I don't know what I did wrong! It could just be that we don't have enough power, or that I've fucked up the connections somewhere or, or [i]anything[/i]."[/k]

That doesn't sound good.

[k]"Oh crap! I've killed us,"[/k] whispers Kendra, [k]"I've [i]killed[/i] us."[/k]

[quote="Alcastar"]I also like how the bending of reality is a fuzzy blackness. just like in real life. :mspa:[/quote]
Alcastar clearly lives a far more adventurous life then the rest of us. :pleasant:
