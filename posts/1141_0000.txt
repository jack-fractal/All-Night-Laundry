"You do realize this isn't the staircase we used to get up here."

[e]"I know that! We'll cut them off from the other direction,"[/e] says Elizabeth. [e]"You heard them, they weren't caught, they were running!"[/e]

"And screaming."

[e]"And screaming, yes."[/e]

"And when we catch up with them," says Castillo. "[i]If[/i] we catch up with them, what are we supposed to do about the [i]twenty invincible monsters?[/i]"

[e]"We'll figure that out when we get there."[/e]
