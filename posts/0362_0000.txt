[quote=xooxu;7587282]>She's right. You do need some rest and definitely some hot chocolate. Did you forget that you were injured pretty badly and have only had an orange since then. Plus you've been on your feet since yesterday morning. [i]And[/i] you just nearly froze to death. You need some sugar, fluids, and warmth. Which is basically everything that hot chocolate is.[/quote]

Yeah, yeah. She [i]knows[/i] that. It's just, dangit, she wants to get OUT of here. She's not - it's just - all right, FINE.

"OK! OK. Just, gimme a second."

[k]"No problem, but if you're not opening that hot chocolate, I will."[/k]

"No no, I got it!"

[quote=Lacemaker;7587201]Take a moment to fill Kendra in a little more. She seems pretty clear on the things you don't know, so it seems like a good idea to give her the information you [i]do[/i] have. After all, you have a little time while you eat your snacks. Maybe explain the dream you had about Piotyr, or the maggot-in-the-corpse-of-a-day thing? Stuff you don't necessarily have the answers for, but you may need later on.[/quote]

OK. Yeah. That makes sense. 

"This lid is really stuck on here."

Kendra not having a clear idea about what is going on isn't good. She should have all the information that Bina has, and she's [i]smart[/i], so she might figure some of this out. Now if only - 

"Aha! Victory and chocolate. My favorite things."

[k]"Trade you one of these granola bars for a cup."[/k]

"Sure thing, do you mind if I just drink from the bottle?"

[k]"Do you have a contagious disease?"[/k]

"Uh... I'm not -"

[k]"'Weird time arm' does not count."[/k]

"Then no."

[k]"Very well, you may drink from the bottle and I will drink from the lid and we will be as hygenic as we can manage given the circumstances."[/k]

"Works for me."

[k]"Great! So what is the plan then?"[/k]

"I guess the first thing I should do is tell you all the stuff about the past-me's and stuff."

[k]"That doesn't sound like a bad idea. I'm getting the idea that you still don't really know what's going on here."[/k]

"No! Well, sorta. It's all a big stupid time puzzle! I've got a lot of pieces but I don't know how they fit together, and someone threw the danged lid out so I'm not even sure what I'm supposed to be making out of all of them. That and half of them might be from the future, or from some other puzzle entirely and it just - argh - it makes my head hurt."

[k]"Wow, a jigsaw puzzle metaphor. You went there." [/k]

"I did, here, take this. Careful! Don't spill!"

[k]"Thanks."[/k]

[img]0362_b.png[/img]

[k]"So what [i]do[/i] you know?"[/k]

"Ok... OK. I know - sluuurp - ow!"

[k]"What?!"[/k]

"Tooth! Missing tooth! I'd forgotten, but then suddenly hot and ow."

[k]"That sounds, like... Not great. I am [i]really[/i] sorry about the whole hitting you with the phone thing, by-the-by."[/k]

"It's ok! Painful, but totally worth it!"

[k]"I know, right? This chocolate is [i]great[/i]."[/k]

"So, anyway... this is what I know so far..."
