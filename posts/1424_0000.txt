[quote="Dave Rapp"]I do like having a page of thumbnails for navigating to different parts of the story, but I don't like that it doesn't have all pages listed. Would it be possible for this new archive page to coexist with the old one? Maybe call that one "archive" and call this new one "map" or something. Sorta like the "map" for Problem Sleuth or Homestuck. I say this partly because traditionally when you click on "archive" for a webcomic you either get a list of all pages or some kind of search function for all pages, not just ever fifth page.[/quote]

Yeeeeah, I could do that. That sounds like a good idea. I'll put that back in over the weekend. Thanks Dave and peeps!
