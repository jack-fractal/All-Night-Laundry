"Hey, Emmie?" says Amie, making a decision she hopes she's not going to regret.

"Oh my!" yells Emmie, at a volume that Amie finds incredibly disproportionate to her level of disclosure, before realizing he's not even looking at her. "What is [i]that[/i]!?"

The thunder catches up, and momentarily deafens everyone.

I am glad to have provided a distraction in your time of need. :)
