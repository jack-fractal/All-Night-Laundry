[quote="musicalEmpathist"]Kendra> Realize what Bina realized before- this whole place is just repeated over and over[/quote]

[k]"It's the same building!"[/k]

"I know."

[quote="musicalEmpathist"]>Kendra: Be amazed at the repetition[/quote]

[k]"No, I mean, the [i]same[/i] building."[/k]

"I know!"

[k]"I went around the back and looked in through the window. It's got the same trucks, the same junk, the same everything. Same coil of wire I used to make the time machine too. And the same roll of tape. I almost snagged that, you can never have enough electrical tape, but I didn't want to have to break the window."[/k]

"Right."

[k]"It's eerie. One of the trucks looks like the axil snapped, so it's sort of listing to the side a bit into the mud, but aside from that... I think it's a copy maybe."[/k]

She looks around.

[k]"This place, this whole underground thing, it's too big. It's got to be at least a kilometre across. Way too big for a sugar factory, right? But if there were lots of copies of the factory sort of smashed into each other-"[/k]

"Like the naughts," says Bina. 

[k]"Yeah! Like the naughts. That makes a weird sort of sense. I still don't get how the ceiling hasn't caved in though. I bet [i]that[/i] drove some of the science people crazy. The support scaffolding near the hole is a bit ridiculous, it can't be what's holding the ceiling up."[/k]

"Yeah."

[k]"Are you ok?"[/k]

[k]"You look kind of shakey. What happened?"[/k]

"I'm fine - just - don't - I'm fine. Really. We should keep going. Find the Moment. I'm rested now. Lets go."

[quote="musicalEmpathist"]
Of course sweetheart, I can probably speak for all of us when I say I'm always here if you need to talk/vent/cry/whatever. And if you're stressing out so much, don't worry about posting for us, we can wait. Work is a bit more important to be focusing on, don't you think?[/quote]

Unlike Bina, I really [i]am[/i] good. I was just trying to do too many things at once. Thank you though.
