[quote=xooxu;7520763]Lmfao. You guys are looking for their porn or something?? Hahahaha. I was thinking sneaking out or doing shots or something. 

That is gross, though. Why would Lash agree to that??[/quote]

I know it's gross! I said that! Right at the start!

But Sam just ran off anyway. She loves gross.

I don't know why Lash didn't stop her. 

I would have! If it were my parents room!

Probably.

Maybe.

I wouldn't have wanted her to do it, anyway.

I think she just honestly didn't think we'd find anything, and didn't feel like dealing with Sam whining.

She was SUPER mortified when we found them though.

[color=#A62A00]"Look at THEEEEESE! Oh my gaaaaaaawd! This is WAAAAY better then I thought it would be!"[/color]

[color=#C10087]"What -"[/color]

[color=#A62A00]"I [i]thought[/i] maybe we'd find a box of condoms, or like, some dirty pictures if I was [i]lucky[/i]. But [i]this[/i]? It's so [i]kinky[/i]!"[/color]

Lash just went kind of quiet.

[color=#A62A00]"I am eating ALL the cake! I don't even care if I get sick. It is worth it! Ha hah! I win! You should see the look on your face!"[/color]

"What is it?" I said, moving closer. I had decided to look in the closet because I didn't really know what we were looking for and Lash's Mom had some really nice coats. 

I couldn't figure out what I was looking at really, it just looked like a ball of pink fuzz in Sam's hands. I thought maybe it was a stuffed animal.

[color=#A62A00]"They're [i]fluffy handcuffs[/i]!"[/color]

She said this like this like it should be a huge revelation. Like it should explain everything.

"Fluffy... handcuffs?"

[color=#A62A00]"I know, right?"[/color]

I had a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. A familiar one.

This was about sex. 

That was what we were there looking for, in Lash's parent room. Sex stuff. I got that, it was sort of gross, and super invasive but I [i]got[/i] that. 

But I didn't understand how [i]this[/i] had anything to do with [i]that[/i]. 

Again. 

Again!

It was happening [i]again[/i].

I thought handcuffs were just for, like, police.

It was [i]always[/i] like this. It was like, everyone else in the whole world got a manual about this big important THING, that explained everything, and had instructions, and numbered lists, and [i]everything[/i], but whoever was handing it out [i]skipped[/i] me. 

I didn't get one.

Silly little Bina, just bumbling along behind everyone, not getting any of the jokes. 

Did you hear that she 'dated' Diego Benitez last year for [i]six weeks[/i] without even [i]knowing[/i] it? She did! She thought he just liked going to movies and to the park! Oh, isn't it just  [i]adorable[/i]! Poor Diego!

I am [i]such[/i] an idiot about this stuff!

It wasn't that I didn't know how... you know, how it [i]worked[/i], at least by this point, but every time I thought I had it sort of figured out, it turned out that there was all this new [i]stuff[/i], this whole new area, and everyone else had got there before me and had taken all the good seats.

This was that. 

[i]AGAAAAIN[/i].

So I didn't say anything. I just sat there. 

I thought that maybe if I didn't say anything, they wouldn't notice.
