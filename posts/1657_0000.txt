OK, this is bad right? This is really bad. Something must have gone wrong. Like - for real wrong. Even if she got delayed or in trouble, she could still come back to this moment and get Amie. So that means she has to have been stopped from doing that [i]permanently[/i]. 

It doesn't mean she's dead!

Amie tells herself several time. It doesn't mean she's dead! It just means she can't come back and get her. There's tons of reasons that might never be able to come back and get her ever, right? 

Amie checks on past-Bina over on the other building -

- but she winks out as soon as she looks over there.

Crap! What should she do?
