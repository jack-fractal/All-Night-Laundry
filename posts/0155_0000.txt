Oh! Maybe. She hadn't thought of that. 

There's still nowhere to HIDE in this little office. How would she do it?

[quote="tegerioreo"]Listen some more.[/quote]

It's not hard, Mrs. Hyung is shouting.

They seem to be arguing about the portable building that she's in. Bina [i]thought[/i] it was in a bizarre location. 

Clipboard girl out there sounds like she's with the municipal government.

What did they find down that hole? It's got to be pretty weird. 

Thankfully, weird is in a plentiful supply around here.

This area? Right here? This is perfectly safe for ten meters in every direction. Solid granite. Canadian shield. Just exactly what the rest of this lot should be.
