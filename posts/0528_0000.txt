[k]"Do you - [/k]

"Yeah. I get it," says Bina.

[k]"But you're right though. You're right, ok?"[/k]

"What?"

[k]"I know you're not an idiot. Really. OK? I know you don't think I do, but I do. Bina, look at me."[/k]

[k]"You've saved my life, a lot, like, more then once, tonight already, and not because of something that some previous version of you did. You did that. [i]You[/i] saved me. If you think that the Moment is at the lab - [/k]

"I do. I know it is!"

[k]"Then that is where it is."[/k]

"But," says Bina, when the silence starts to stretch, because, of course, there is a 'but'.

[k]"[i]But[/i], I'm supposed to be dead, right? Either I wasn't involved, or I [i]died[/i] in all the loops before this one. I have never been here before."[/k]

"I don't know about [i]all[/i] the loops, but with what B12 said, and then Gregor trying to kill you... I mean, yeah, probably."

[k]"So maybe - [/k]

[quote="Dalmationer"]Kendra is basically one of Bina's biggest edges right now, not just because she can help, but because she /doesn't react in the same way as Bina./

If the Green Lady has been through this 13 times, then she probably has a good idea how Bina reacts to things. What she is likely to do.

Kenda throws a spanner in the works there.[/quote]

"Maybe if we do what you say then they won't be able to anticipate us. I get it, OK? We should go to the subway."

[k]"No! That's not what I'm saying at all. I mean, OK, I [i]was[/i] saying that, but now I've had a chance to think about it, no! I mean - the subway - that's a [i]logical[/i] thing to do, right? Which is why we shouldn't do it."[/k]

"What? Now [i]you[/i] want to go to the lab?"

[quote="tegerioreo"]Time to do something you would never do.[/quote]

[k]"No! Not that either. We need to do something [i]completely nuts![/i]"[/k]
