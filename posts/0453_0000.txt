[quote="xooxu"]>Bina: numbly translate for Gregor. "[size=10]She said you're a monster...[/size]"[/quote]

"She said you're a monster."

"Hmm? Ooooh. Yes. I know this thing."

"Why did you do it!? Why!?" 

[quote="Lacemaker"]Is that a protective hero-hug I see? Kendra, you may want to keep a tight grasp on that wildcat, because once she snaps from grief to rage Gregor is in for a [i]world[/i] of pain.[/quote]

"She never did [i]anything[/i] to you! You [i]asshole![/i] You didn't need to do that!"

"But if I am not doing this thing, she is throwing the button-box down the hole, yes? And then it is breaking the wire, you see? Then she is running and screaming and I am have to chase her all over the place. Is very tiring. This way is better."

"You killed her because you're [i]tired[/i]?"

"Ah, well... it sounds pretty bad when you say it like that."

"Is long day though, you know? And the science man. He is big. Very heavy. I must use much plastic. But mostly it is... when I am to chase her I... what is word? I am... compound? No, this is not it. I break her? Is not right word, but you know what I am saying. I break her very much. In legs. You see? Much pain. Is messy. This way, not so much. Bop, she is dead. No worries. No mess. Better this way."
