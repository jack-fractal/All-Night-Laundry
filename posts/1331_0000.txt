Mel looks scared. She's hiding it, but Kendra can tell. That scares Kendra, because Kendra has, until now, been half convinced that, at about the age of eight, Melissa found the technique that converted fear into anger.

She looks like she wants to say something but Kendra is not sure she is equipped to handle this conversation right now.
