[quote=xooxu;7876754]Say you aren't exactly sure, it isn't exactly the truth, but it isn't exactly a lie. Tell her you need to get her away from the void first, then you can explain what you know. You can stay back, keep your distance, whatever she needs to feel safe, but moving is the priority.[/quote]

[k]"We don't... know. Not for sure. We [i]think[/i] they're in trouble but we don't know for sure."[/k]

[e]"What kind of trouble and who'se 'we'?"[/e]

[k]"My friend Bina is here too, the girl I was with before downstairs. Can you PLEASE just move away from the edge?"[/k]

[e]"All right! Back up and-"[/e]

[k]"Don't stand up! You have a pretty major head injury and you might [i]fall[/i] and I cannot emphasize enough how dangerous the thing behind you is. Just... crawl. Please."[/k]

[quote=badatnamesbluhbluh;7876843]>Listen. This is a precarious situation. Please just trust me and get away from that cliff, then I'll try to answer every question you have to the best of my ability.[/quote]

[k]"I know nothing makes sense! I know you're confused and I know you're probably scared, but you have to trust me when I say we're trying to help you."[/k]

[e]"I think you'll find that I don't [i]actually[/i] have to do that."[/e]

[k]"I know but just - don't get [i]hurt[/i] just because you don't trust me. If you've been down in the factory you KNOW something [i]weird[/i] is going on. I know you do, it's obvious, but I don't think you quite grasp the level of weird we're talking about. On a scale of 1 to weird we are very, very, [i]very[/i] weird."[/k]

That seems to be getting to her, as the scissors waver for a moment, though Kendra suspects that might just be fatigue. 

[e]"All right,"[/e] says Elizabeth. 

[k]"Look, you don't have to believe me but we [i]are[/i] trying to help, and we have gone to frankly some [i]absurd[/i] lengths to help you already."[/k]

[e]"All right! Here's how we play this. I'm going to - uhh - is that a dog?"[/e]

[quote=Luvyna;7876181]> Piotyr: Be inexplicably down in what remains of the construction site as well.[/quote]

[k]"Oh... umm - well - that is actually a rather complicated question."[/k]

[e]"I-I think I know that dog,"[/e] says Elizabeth, her voice high and funny. 

[k]"Uhh..."[/k] says Kendra, with a sudden suspicion that this probably isn't going to turn out very well.

[e]"That's the dog from the laundromat," says Elizabeth, her eyes wide and staring. "It is, isn't it?"[/e]

[k]"Err... yeah, it is - she is,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"Sort of. Her name is Piotyr. She's not going to hurt you - probably - I mean the worst she's done to me is just sort of whine at me until I gave her all my bacon but-"[/k]

[e]"[i]That[/i] dog is [i]dead[/i]."[/e]
