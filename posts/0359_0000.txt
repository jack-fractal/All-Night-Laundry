[k]"It could be soup."[/k]

"Noooo it's hot chocolate."

"Because it's TOTALLY what I would pack for this situation!"

[k]"And.... and [i]you[/i] packed it, didn't you? This is more time travel junk, right?"[/k]

"There's a time loop involved, and I don't really understand a lot of it, and I haven't really had any time to [i]think[/i] about it, but - look - I'll explain the whole thing AFTER we have chocolate, ok?"

[k]"Seems reasonable. Hand me one of those granola bars."[/k]

"Here you go and - oh."
