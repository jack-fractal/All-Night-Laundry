"Come have a look at this map."

[quote="Sporothrix"]> Any idea where you came from/through in that mess of squares?[/quote]

[k]"What am I looking at here? Which way did we come in?"[/k]

"This way," says Bina, "I think these three buildings here are those buildings just over there. The ones connected together with walkways."

[k]"So we came in through area five?"[/k]

"I think they're calling them 'sectors'."

[k]"Well that makes sense."[/k]

"It does? I always thought 'sector' was a sort of silly name for -

[k]"No! Not that. I mean that we came in through number five. You remember the flags. They all were '5-something' right? 5-72, 5-68."[/k]

"Right, yeah. You realize you're still holding a shoe, right?"

[k]"What? Oh, this?" [/k]

[img]0402_c.png[/img]

"I wonder why they have so many shoes?"

[k]"I dunno, but there's about fifty of them on that table over there."[/k]

"Hmmm, so I guess that shoe is from... over here? Sector three, building 14."

[k]"Probably."[/k]

"Are they all labled like that?"

[k]"Everything on the tables is. I haven't checked the boxes yet."[/k]

[quote="The One Guy"]> There's a [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(rapid_transit)]metro[/url] on the map!  After taking care of business here, that may be your way out![/quote]

"Ok, I think we can get out here. See? Metro. I bet that's a subway tunnel or something."

[img]0402_e.png[/img]

[quote="tegerioreo"]You'd think if all this had been here when the Metro was dug, somebody else would have known about it before now...[/quote]

[k]"Yeah, but... I mean, if it were a subway tunnel, wouldn't someone have found it? I mean..."[/k]

"It could be a siding. One of the little tracks used to let the trains pass each other."

[k]"Even so. This place is huge! Someone would have found [i]something[/i]. Wouldn't they?"[/k]

>>>NOTES:

[quote="Viiranen"]Bina: Also Wong (The nice-ish lady stuck to the TV) lied to you (I think). Her names right there. She said she was working on a building(?), when in reality she was in charge of this thing instead. What ever [i]this[/i] is... [Either that or I'm remembering everything wrong][/quote]

You're remembering it sort of wrong, specifically her name. The name of the woman on the couch is Sun-ja Hyung, not Wong. She might have been lying to Bina, but, if she was, it would not be the way you are thinking.
