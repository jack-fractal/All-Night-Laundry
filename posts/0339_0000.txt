[color=#C10087]"Why not jump into [i]her[/i] head?"[/color]

"You're crazy, which, I guess, means that [i]I[/i] am crazy. Great! Thank you subconscious, glad to have that one figured out."

[color=#C10087]"No! It makes sense!"[/color]

"How does it make sense? I'm trying to [i]avoid[/i] having Debbie chow down on Piotyr. Kind of hard to do that if I'm inside her head, isn't it?"

[color=#C10087]"No, look. You leave Piotyr here with me. If you're in Debbie's head, then Debbie, by extension [i]can't[/i] be in your head. That means that Piotyr is safe-ish - [/color]

"Assuming I don't [i]die[/i]."

"This is a terrible idea."

[color=#C10087]"You love it! You [i]know[/i] you love it."[/color]

"I [i]do[/i]. Here, take the dog."
