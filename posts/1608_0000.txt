[quote="Heyoceama"]Why would an elevator have a door handle?[/quote]

That's a good question, maybe it's a door to a room [i]with[/i] an eleva-

Bugger.

"Hello?" says Amie, her voice echoing down the metal staircase. Why is she [i]here?[/i] 

She steps forward to head down, but then stops. She smells something, unexpected but not unpleasant.

[i]Food[/i]. Something spicy, frying. The smell wakes up Amie's stomach (and her bladder) who cheerfully inform her that she's been asleep for a while, quite a while, she's hungry. How long was she out? Didn't she just eat pizza?

When she thinks about that, her hip fails to twinge in pain. It is aggressively and entirely normal. This non-sensation is disconcerting enough that she nearly trips and falls on her impromptu skirt.

The smell of food is coming from [i]up[/i] the staircase.

[quote="JR"]After a week of reading, I'm finally caught up. At the end of Chapter 2 I was hoked and knew I couldn't read this at work anymore (I had too much work to do). So I started reading it at home. It has consumed so much time. And it has been SO worth it. I have read so many web comics, but this one. This has stolen my heart. All those awesome jaw dropping moments, all the times I laughed, all the times I actually cried! And now I'm here where I can drop comments and suggestions! A million "thank you"s Zach for doing this marvelous thing. You have fashioned something truly special and spectacular here. =)[/quote]

Aah! Thank you so much for reading all the way through, and thank you for your very kind and encouraging words.
