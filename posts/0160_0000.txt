The wind is loud and a particularly sharp gust hits her just as she gets the painting away from the wall. She staggers as she drops the painting. There is a sharp crack as the frame hits the floor.

[quote=tegerioreo;7388345]Probably you should read that message behind the painting, which was probably left by a Future Bina who traveled to the past to warn Past-Present-Pluperfect Bina about something VITALLY IMPORTANT.[/quote]

She honestly has no idea what to make of this.
