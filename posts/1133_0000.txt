"Dammit!" says Bina, grabbing the two of them. "Back here! Quick!"

All three of them wedge themselves into the small alcove the back of the generator extends into. It's hot, and dry, the metal cauldron of the generator rumbling beside them.

"Sorry!" says Emmie. "They're so fast."

[k]"If it comes this way we're [i]screwed[/i],"[/k] says Kendra.
 
"I'm [i]reeeally[/i] missing my hammer," says Bina. 

The naught ignores them, it's body a nearly random collection of limbs, extra skulls pock mark it's torso, like plague scars, and the unconscious or possibly dead form of a middle-aged woman nearly encased in it's waxy flesh.

It disappears around the corner of their generator, and after a few seconds, it's footsteps are lost in the hum of the machines.

[k]"Crap,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"Crap! This is not good."[/k]
