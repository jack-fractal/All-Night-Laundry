[k]"Is everyone ok?"[/k] yells Kendra.

"Uhh... yeah," says Emmie, setting his glasses back into place and making sure all his limbs are still attached. The creature's arm had nearly knocked him off his feet. "I'm good."

"Uhhh..." says Amie. "Holy shit. Hooooly shit!"

[k]"Amie?"[/k]

"Hmm?"

[k]"Are you OK?"[/k]

"Y-yeah I'm good, just, you know, holy shit!"

"Aaah crap," says Edwards, from the floor. "Fuck."

"Edwards? Crap, Jackie are you OK?" asks Castillo, moving over towards her. 

"Just - a scratch," says Edwards, in the short sharp words of someone in pain. "I'm fine. Glad I wore. My vest today. Hah!"

[k]"Emmie? Can you check on her."[/k]

"Already doing it."

[k]"I need to see where Piotyr's taking him."[/k]

"Careful with the edge!" calls Amie.

[k]"Just shut up and I'll be fine."[/k]
