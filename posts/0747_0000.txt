We could go and smash a hundred new holes in time and not even come close to amount of entropy that went into these things. You only ever built two: One to look forward, and one to look back."[/k]

"Right."

[k]"Hmm… thinking of that. Total entropy remaining. I bet we could figure that out. Find out exactly how much power we've got left before the whole thing comes down. I think, I think yeah, I think Six wrote something about that but never actually did it. The math is funny, it's some kind of hyperplane manifold, but we might be able to -[/k]
