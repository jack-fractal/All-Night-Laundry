[quote="xooxu"]Elizabeth: So how did you even come by this alternate universe. [i]Why?[/i] 

I don't think Kendra would answer it completely, but it does feel like something anyone would reasonably fixate on.[/quote]

[quote="tegerioreo"]Ask about this crazy self-contained collapsing universe you're in right now.  What exactly is the [b]deal[/b] with that?[/quote]

[e]"OK! I will then! How did we get here?!? This is an alternate universe?"[/e]

[k]"More a kind of pocket dimension really, or like, a slice of reality that's been... -"[/k]

[e]"Pocket dimension! Whatever! How did we [i]get[/i] here? More importantly, how do I [i]leave[/i]? Can you -"[/e]

"Why is everyone shouting?"

[k]"Bina, ahh! We're being loud. Sorry."[/k]

[e]"Uhh.. hi. Hello."[/e]

"Hi Elizabeth," croaks Bina. "I'm Bina."

[e]"Hi."[/e]

"I'm glad you're not dead."

[e]"Uh... oh, hello. I'm Elizabeth, but you... already know that, I - well - I am glad I'm not dead too!"[/e]

"Are you two fighting?"

[k]"We're not really fighting we're just... talking really loud."[/k]

[e]"Yeah, we're ok. Sorry - didn't mean to disturb you."[/e]

"Is your head all right?"

[e]"It hurts a little, but I'm OK."[/e]

"That's good. Gregor's a big..." she trails off searching for a proper descriptor and not finding one. Eventually she settles on, "Jerk."

[k]"We'll keep it down, go back to bed Bina."[/k]

"Uh huh..."

[k]"And don't trip on the blanket!"[/k]

"I won't..."
