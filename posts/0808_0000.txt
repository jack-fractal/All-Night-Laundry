[quote="Leonstar0"]THIS IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED.[/quote]

[k]"OK! So this is not what [i]I[/i] was expecting,"[/k] says Kendra with a forced smile. 

[quote="a52"]She looks like she's been through some shit.[/quote]

What she doesn't say is that the Bina on the screen looks like she's been down about five hundred miles of bad road. She turns to the Bina beside her. [k]"What about you Bina? Were you expecting this?"[/k]

"Errr..." 

Current Bina is apparently having trouble forming words.

There is a long pause. 

[k]"Bina!"[/k] hisses Kendra, [k]"Say something!"[/k]

Current Bina does not appear inclined to say anything, so Kendra takes over.

[quote="AlphabetizedInsanity"]> Don't be rude, introduce yourself. She might not know which loop (assuming this is a different Bina) she's looking at, and, maybe she'll do the same?[/quote]

[k]"Hello! It's um, nice to meet you. We are, we think, in the thirteenth loop. If it's not rude to ask, which loop are [i]you[/i] in?"[/k]

"Hello Kendra," says the other Bina, "It's nice to finally meet you. Your question is a tricky one. I don't know for sure which loop I'm in. I know there have been at least a few before me, possibly quite a few, but I haven't been able to figure out how many."

[quote="Leonstar0"]SHE'S NUMBER 3![/quote]

"I've decided to go with 'Three' for the moment. It's a good number, and it's no more or less wrong then any other number. Lets go with that. I am Three, and [i]you[/i] are Thirteen."

[quote="wolftamer9"](That reminds me, Jack, this is a reminder about those Piotyr-static illustrations and the retcons if you still haven't done them.)[/quote]

This, it turns out, is actually kind of hard, as both those threads are locked. I'd have to get them unlocked, then do the edits, then get them relocked. A bit of a hassle! 

My plan is to add both sets of missing panels when I create the a website for this thing!

And I do plan on doing that! I plan on making a website! Soonish! (no but seriously, this is actually a plan this time).
