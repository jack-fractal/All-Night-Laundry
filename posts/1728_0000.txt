"... but in Chechnya this is enough."

>>>NOTES:

The events that Gregor is talking about took place in the second Russian-Chechen war, around 2006. He's not overstating the situation with the land-mines either. By some estimates there are over a million land-mines in a country half the size of Maine.

De-mining an area, the thing that Gregor was doing, is pain-staking, dangerous, time consuming, and expensive. It's also [i]necessary[/i], and is not being done at the scale that it needs to be, especially not in Chechnya, where thousands of people die or are maimed every year.

I wanted to link a land-mine relief charity that works in Chechnya, but I can't find any who are doing that. I've heard good things about [url=https://www.apopo.org/en]APOPO[/url] though, an organization who trains rats to sniff out land-mines, and diagnose tuberculosis. They are working in Cambodia now, which is another country with a terrifying number of land-mines from over thirty years of war. 

If you have a few dollars to spare, consider sponsoring them.
