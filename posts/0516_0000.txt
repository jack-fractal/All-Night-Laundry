[quote="tegerioreo"]Although you have secretly wanted to [i]get down[/i] with Kendra for a while, ( :winky: ) that's probably not what this is about.  Ask her what's going on?  Some new threat?  More threatening version of old threats?  What??[/quote]

Yes! 

Wait, no! 

It's like - 

OK, there [i]may[/i] have been [i]one or two[/i] scenarios that [i]might[/i] have wandered across her mind, AT SOME POINT, and those scenarios could have [i]maybe[/i] started with Kendra grabbing her and pulling her down onto the floor. 

OK? 

Maybe! 

But this is NOT one of those. 

Probably.

It's not! It totally definitely isn't.

Now if only her face had gotten the memo.

She tries to play serious.

"What is it?"

[k]"Shhh!"[/k]

At least Kendra doesn't seem to notice her blushing. 

Good. That's good, right?

[size=10]"Ok, ok... what is it?"[/size]

[k]"Over here... shhh..."[/k]

Kendra points.
