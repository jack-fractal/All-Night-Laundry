Neither of them want to dwell on the light going out, so they head inside the pressure tent.

Kendra explains about the medical records.

[quote=tegerioreo;7629473]Kendra:  Conclude that Specimen 2-4 probably grew into adulthood with a normal, uncluttered chest cavity.  Also assume that 7-12 must have had a normal arm to go with his un-atrophied muscles.  The event that caused the deformities probably also killed them.[/quote]

"Well they can't have been [i]alive[/i] like that."

[k]"Some people [i]are[/i] born with extra limbs you know."[/k]

[quote=Fuade;7629465]Might be a bunch of time-lines bleeding into each-other[/quote]

"Yeah, but six? And the woman with the rib-cages? No. It's gotta be something to do with the time shenanigans."

[k]"That's what I was thinking. Here, hold this. I think there's gloves too."[/k]

"This one's for [i]you[/i] right?"

[k]"No, that's yours."[/k]

"It's huge! Its never going to fit me."

[k]"It's the smallest one here and, if we have any luck, you'll only end up wearing it for like ten minutes."[/k]

"I'm going to look really goofy."

[k]"On the plus side, looking goofy is a thing most people survive. And thank heavens for that, because otherwise nobody would have lived through the eighties. Aha gloves! I knew there were gloves. And tape. Good."[/k]

"Our friend up there. She doesn't seem to know what's going on."

[k]"Not really, no. Neither do the people down here, if their files are any indication. I can't get a handle on how they're treating it. The files are all classified, and she mentioned a quarantine, but there's no guards or anything. "[/k]

"Yeah, and the board outside showed what? A dozen people working here?"

[k]"It feels too small. They're treating it like a chemical spill or something. I don't think they've realized what they're dealing with."[/k]

"I'd feel a lot better about saying that if [i]we[/i] had any idea what we're dealing with."

[k]"That is a valid point."[/k]

"So how exactly are we supposed to put these things on?"

[k]"I was kind of hoping you'd know."[/k]

"Crap."
