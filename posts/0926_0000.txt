Bina spends several minutes entering commands.

She gives a dry chuckle, "Well, a little good news! We didn't destroy all of the things!"

Kendra tries to muster some enthusiasm. [k]"Yay."[/k]

"Bad news is... jeeze, we mucked up that whole area pretty bad, and uh... we increased overall entropy by a lot. I don't think we should go anywhere near there again."

[k]"Good idea. How is the Moment doing?"[/k]

"Err... lemme check. Hmmm, not so great, Elizabeth is still on a jump, so it's under a lot of pressure again..."

[k]"Great."[/k]

"It's just one person this time, so its not as bad as before with the two of us, it's just - eurgh..."
