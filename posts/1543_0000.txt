[k]"So!"[/k] says Kendra, trying not to appear too desperate. [k]"Will you do it?"[/k]

"What?"

[k]"Get your friend to deliver the pizza!"[/k]

[k]"Nope!"[/k] says Kendra, even though yes it would totally count. She decides to try more money. That worked so well last time. [k]"I can spare another fifty bucks? I really want this to go off without a hitch."[/k]

She also really wants to [i]strangle[/i] Amie, and everyone who has ever written Doctor Who.

[k]"Please?"[/k]

"Weeeeeelllll...."

Come on little time machine! You can do it! Kendra didn't spend all that time fixing you for nothing!

Kendra exhales. 

"I mean - fifty bucks is fifty bucks and he owes me, so I think I can get him to do it."

And Kendra feels the unearthly wind picking at her jacket and hair stutter and die.
