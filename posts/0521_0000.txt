[quote=tronn;7680016]>Bina: Horatio's behavior sounds naughty.[/quote]

"Oh no! I'm sorry! I thought they'd all follow me!"

[k]"It's ok. Really. It must have been worse for you. How did you stay ahead of all of them?"[/k]

"I just ran mostly. They're not very fast."

[k]"I thought that, but then Horatio got faster after I hit him."[/k]

"You hit him?!"

Kendra fills Bina in on the rest of what happened on her way back to camp.

[quote=tronn;7677043]>Bina: How on Earth he got down when the crane is out of operation? Maybe there's another way up![/quote]

[quote=BreadProduct;7677044]All he did was turn the crane off. What's stopping him from turning it back on?[/quote]

"Was the crane down while you were there? I bet that's how Gregor got down here." 

[k]"Uuuuuuhhhh, I can't remember? I... no, sorry. I was running for my life at that point."[/k]

Kendra explains about encountering Horatio in the bathroom and the ensuing chase.

"Yikes!"

[k]"He was not the friendliest fellow."[/k]

"So you're calling them Naughts?"

[k]"Yeah I guess. We've been calling the monster dog thing the Not-Dog right? So these are pretty clearly Not-People. Not-People. Naughts? Get it?"[/k]

"Oooh! I thought you meant, like, ASTROnaughts. That - yeah, ok. I get it now."

[k]"Well what have you been calling them?"[/k]

"Wigglies! 'Cause they... you know... they sorta wiggle. A lot. I dunno, I like your name better."

[k]"I dunno. Wigglies isn't a bad name. They do sort of twitch a lot. And they can, like, unfold? And this lets them make more mass somehow? Like, poof! Screw the second law of thermodynamics! Horatio just sort of vomited out [i]another[/i] torso when I hit him with the pipe, then it... it sort of ate and re-purposed the bits of Yorrick I threw at him. Their skin can move like runny [i]wax[/i]. No, that's not quite right, it's like - [/k]

"Eww! Eww forever! No more. Please. Eww."

[k]"OK. How did you do?"[/k]

"Well... I didn't really get close to any of them like you did..."

Bina explains about her escape from the Naughts. 

[k]"Do you know how many of them followed you?"[/k]

"Maybe ten? I couldn't keep track of them, and I think I lost maybe two really early. They were having problems with their legs. The others, they didn't just chase me in a group like zombies. They kept slipping away to turn up in front of me, or drop down from a window. One of them with a bunch of arms nearly got me that way."

[k]"I think they're at least [i]sort of[/i] intelligent."[/k]

"I think so too, but - its weird - they didn't really seem like they were [i]trying[/i] very hard. I mean, to catch me. They [i]chased[/i] me, but that seemed to be sort of the point? The chasing? Like it was a game. I don't know if I'm making much sense. They seemed [i]insincere[/i] in their attempts to grab me. At least, until I trapped two of them inside a small room and dived into the drain. That seemed to make at least one of them really mad."

[k]"You did [i]what[/i]!?"[/k]

"I - well - like I said, it seemed like a good idea at the time!"

Bina, while attempting to minimize the danger, explains about getting stuck in the drain.

[k]"Oh my god. How [i]wide[/i] was it? The pipe?"[/k]

"Maybe like this?"

[k]"Oh my god! Did you at least look to see if there was a way out?!"[/k]

"Yeeeeeessss...?"

[k]"Really?"[/k]

"Sort of! I saw there was a [i]light[/i] at the end soooo...

[k]"You are so lucky that you are not dead."[/k]

"Hey! I'm not the one who went into a tent with one door when there was one of them right on my heels!"

[k]"That's totally different!"[/k]

"It so totally isn't different!"
