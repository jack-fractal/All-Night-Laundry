Bina is pretty sure it needs direct contact. That means she has to get over to where Kendra and Elizabeth are.

That should be impossible what with the whole 'everything is breaking' thing but hey...

It should make an easy bridge here or at least a nice rope for you to make closing the gap trivial.[/quote]

It'll be fun![/quote]
