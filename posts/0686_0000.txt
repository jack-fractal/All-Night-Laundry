Thanks everyone, but I can't take credit for that amazing blobby thing in the background. THAT is the [url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic0506b/]Eagle Nebula[/url]. One of the greatest photographs to ever be taken, on the most expensive camera ever made. 

About six months ago I happened upon a collection of images from the Hubble Space telescope. I knew, when I saw them, that I had to do something with them. Most of the deep background stuff in the last section have been retinted, blurred, stretched and recoloured images from the Hubble telescope.

I encourage anyone who hasn't taken a look at the Hubble galleries to do so. They are amazing, and gorgeous and well worth your time.
