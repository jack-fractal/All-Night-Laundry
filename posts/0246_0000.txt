Can she do something about that? From here? From now? Can she change this? If she left, right then, what would happen? She wouldn't meet the dog. Which means she wouldn't end up in the factory. So she wouldn't see the Botfly. 

If she were gone, Gregor wouldn't go out for more murder-plastic, which would mean he wouldn't find Kendra ticketing cars nearby, which would mean that she'd be safe too!
