Yeah, Piotyr doesn't seem like she's sliding much!

And she's not to keen too just jump into any random time-pool she finds, she's got no idea where she'll end up, and the enormous monster will just follow her.

[quote="AlphabetizedInsanity"]>Bina: If you can't get in the pool/crater, can you at least angle yourself to give the Not-Piyotr a face full of your muddy boots?[/quote]

That didn't work out so well for her the last time she tried it!

[quote="Kíeros"]> Bina: Try to scamper back upwards.[/quote]

On the list of 'things she didn't think she was going to have to do when she woke up today' this is pretty high up there.

[quote="AlphabetizedInsanity"]I just remembered we left poor Kendra back up in the laundromat. I hope she isn't completely freaking out.[/quote]

Up above her, almost lost in the distance, Bina hears a scream.
