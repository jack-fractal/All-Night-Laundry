Nnngh. Almost got it....

Bina reaches into the gap between washers. To her right, the washer holding her clothes hums smoothly, going into a rinse cycle.

Gggyeaaah!

That just happened right? 

Everyone saw that? Right? A sort of arm... claw... thing?

In the washing machine? 

That was a real thing that happened. Right? 'Cause if that DIDN'T just happen, Bina is going to have something REALLY interesting to tell her psychia -

Bina would like to point out that it does not appear to be made of clothes.
