What? It says... "Change". 'Cause it's a change machine. You put money in it. You get change. 

It's always said "Change". 

Right?

That's right isn't it?

Bina is unnerved.

Bina approaches the TV. It doesn't look particularly hoojoo-ey, but Bina's not really clear on what hoojoo is or how one might identify it.

This TV might be all UP in that hoojoo and she'd not even know it.

Bina thinks she should stop with the word hoojoo now.

Bina considers smashing the TV. This whole  situation is sort of weird, and kind of scary.

She gives the TV a couple of good raps on the side instead. It doesn't appear to do anything. The picture remains fuzzy.
