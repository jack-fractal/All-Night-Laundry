It's several subjective hours and a surprisingly small amount of shenanigans later. They're back in the Moment trying to figure out a way to save Elizabeth. 

"Eh, never mind," says Bina, and yawns. "This is getting really complicated Kendra."

[k]"I'm pretty sure if we stick it at a 60 degree angle we can keep her inside the smokestack. I think it's possible! We just have to get the angle and velocity [i]just[/i] right and she'll land right on the ledge."[/k]

[quote="Fuade"]Well just flipping her momentum to where she flies upward would be too hard to calculate effectively. [/quote]

"And if we get them [i]just wrong[/i] she'll smack right into the wall, or miss the ledge entirely and fall [i]another[/i] forty feet!"
