"OK, how long?"

"What?" asks Mel. 

"How long unti I can walk on it?" asks Bina. 

"Two or three days I'd expect - at the least, that's assuming it doesn't get infected [i]and[/i] you really haven't hurt a tendon or bone."

[quote="Chaz Wallace"]Just to screw with Mel, give Kendra time to explain, and Bina time to heal, take her to the moment.[/quote]

"Do we have enough time for that?" asks Bina, looking at Kendra. "In the Moment? Were you taking measurements?"

[quote="ForestGardener"]Only a few days left in there, a couple of weeks tops, but Bina IS going to need to run again soon.
This is a good idea.[/quote]

[k]"Hmmm,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"We wouldn't get squished I don't think. Without jump stress, the shrinking is back to the rate that Six and Seven pinned it at, so we have some time before running out of space becomes a serious problem - but we're kind of out of food."[/k]

"Really?"

[k]"Yeah, unless you want to eat doggy kibble..."[/k]

"Argh," says Bina.

"Did you understand any of that?" Emmie asks Amie.

"They're talking about their TARDIS!" says Amie. "Which I haven't seen yet, so I endorse this plan!"

btw remember when the guy said he doesn't keep up with the new music? Well, I think Celadon Jungle sounds like a band/album name, too.

Aah! That's great! Thank you so much CloudMonarch43!

Dave Rapp is right, I should make a fanart album. I'll put that on my list for next week. 

Thanks again and Happy New Year everyone! 

We lived.
