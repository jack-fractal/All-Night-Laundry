[e]"What the hell is going on?! Who are you? Is this the site? What [i]is[/i] that if it isn't a wall? What have you done with my team!?"[/e]

[k]"I'm Kendra. I was uh... I was downstairs and we talked on the phone. The phone on the crane? You brought us up in the gondola on the crane because we were trapped, remember?"[/k]

[k]"Umm... does that mean you remember or...?"[/k]

[e]"It means 'OK'. Where is my team?"[/e]
