[size=10]"Is she gone?"

[k]"I wouldn't count on it,"[/k][/size] says Kendra. [size=10][k]"Did you find the stupid Moment thing yet? Aside from large-dog-and-scary out there we're about to be drowning in Shakespearian characters."[/k]

[quote="Lacemaker"]Complain to Kendra about how terribly your other self is treating you.[/quote]

"No! I just found this fricking note from my jerk old self being a jerk!"

[quote=DS]Show the note to Kendra. Maybe she could make heads or tails of it[/quote]

[k]"What does this even mean?"[/k]

"I have no idea!"[/size] says Bina, [size=10]"Maybe it would have made sense to me, if I'd shown up when I was supposed to, but now it's just nonsense."

[k]"Why even write in code?"[/k]

"Oh, I know that one. It's so Gregor wouldn't be able to figure out where the Moment was if he found the note."

[k]"Gregor doesn't [i]speak French[/i],"[/k][/size] says Kendra. [size=10][k]"This is written [i]in[/i] French. Why not just say exactly where it is?"[/k][/size]

"Because I am an [i]idiot[/i] apparently!"

[size=10][k]"Shh!"[/k]

"Right. Sorry."

[k]"Look, this could mean like a million things."[/k]

"I know..."

[quote="xooxu"]>Well, start with obvious. Any globes or maps?? Maybe an atlas or something?[/quote]

[quote="Xander"]Search for anything that has a picture of Earth on it. Models, pictures, representations.[/quote]

[k]"Or it... could just be really obvious. Like behind a map of the world, or something."[/k]

"Well I can't see any [i]maps[/i] in this ominous and faintly unnerving gloom! Can you?"

[k]"No, but there were lights on the last time you were here, right? Wouldn't it make sense for her - you - whatever - to pick something that was here before?"[/k][/size]
