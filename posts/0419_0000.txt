[quote=Lacemaker;7625020]Bina: shower in peace without us peeping in on you. 

Kendra: become main focus. Investigate that blood.[/quote]

[k]Kendra puts the chair back by the desk then bends down to look at the blood.

This doesn't look good. It's not a [i]lot[/i] of blood, but it's more then you'd see from something accidential. 

Hmm.

It's still tacky. Not fully dried yet.

[quote=tegerioreo;7625394]Kendra:  Get yo' snoop on while Bina is showering.[/quote]

[quote=ArcusofBrambles;7624977]And now we discover Bina's REAL superpower.  The ability to blush so hard it shows up even underneath layers and layers of mud!  -snickers-

>Kendra: Super sleuth mode![/quote]

If Kendra were one of the inexplicably sexy forensic technicians on a crime procedural, she could tell you precisely what that means, but she's not. 

Blood dries pretty fast though, right? So, whoever spilled this, they're probably not too far away.

Maybe she shouldn't be leaving Bina alone out there.[/k]

>>>NOTES:

[quote=Lacemaker;7625020]Every time you update this, I have to fight the urge to literally squee. This new style of Bina is just so [i]adorable![/i] It's almost like I'm reading it for the art itself, rather than the storyline. (and for me the storyline is how I judge pretty much every media. I don't care about graphics or special features or runtime, just give me a good story dangit!) Now this has both. Awesome story and awesome art. Factor in the punishing update pace you set yourself, and you really spoil us, JackFractal. Thank you! :3[/quote]

Thanks Lacemaker! That's really nice of you to say!

Bina's design has changed a whole lot, not just between art styles, but also just as gradual slow distortion as I keep drawing without a final model sheet.

Glad you're still liking it!

It's one of Bina's things! She blushes easily, and obviously. 

This made her life in high-school significantly more complicated then it otherwise would have been.
