"Yeah. Can you check the desk?"

[k]"Sure."[/k]

"It isn't?"

[k]"No, smells like... I dunno, turpentine maybe? Something chemical."[/k]

"Can't be worse then the rest of the room."

[k]"Then wouldn’t he have found this Moment thing?"[/k]

"I don’t know, ok?! I must have hidden it. Previous me. B12."

[k]"Or it’s not even here."[/k]

"Just - I haven’t even had a chance to look around yet. OK? Gimme a second."

[k]"You better be quick, otherwise we gotta start [i]running[/i]."[/k][/size]
