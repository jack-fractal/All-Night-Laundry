Hah ha! Yeah! Just what she wanted...

If she were in a horror game, wouldn't she have more guns? She feels like she should have more guns, or maybe like a [i]sword[/i]. She's feeling dramatically under-served in the high-explosives department as well.

It does have a little loop strap thing. She loops her wrist through it, careful not to tangle it with the IV line. 

She looks around to make sure she's not forgetting something and absolutely not because she really doesn't want to go out into that dark hallway at all.

She considers taking the bag, just in case, but what would be the point?
