[FONT=Courier New][i][b]Image. Medium Shot.[/b] Lash and Bina in front of the dryers. Lash looks worried and has grabbed Bina's arm. Bina looks annoyed and has entirely reverted to the Hard-Pixel Laundromat Style. She is still wearing her dress.[/i][/font]

[color=#C10087]"Bina! Wait!"[/color]

"You drop that right now young lady!"

[color=#C10087]"Oh, you are impossible! Have you even [i]heard[/i] of self-preservation? Wait for me!"[/color]
