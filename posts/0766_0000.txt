[k]"They're just trees Bina."[/k]

[quote="Bohandas"]>They're another living thing that's here...[/quote]

"But they're [i]alive[/i]! And they're [i]here[/i]!"

[k]"OK, so the Moment has plants. So what?"[/k]

"Doesn't that strike you as weird? Like, no animals, not even [i]bacteria[/i], but trees are fine?"

[k]"Ok, yeah, but-"[/k]

"And why is that even a thing!? The thing with the animals. From the perspective of quantum mechanics, atoms are all pretty much the same, right?"

[k]"Well, that's not entirely-"[/k]

"And [i]leather[/i] still exists, you have some in your shoes, and [i]meat[/i] is fine, so it's just [i]living[/i] animals who don't exists here."

[k]"I guess."[/k]

"But there's [i]no[/i] difference between a living animal and a dead animal at the quantum level, right?"

[k]"Yeah, ok, sure. That's pretty strange. But is that all you were worried about? Maybe B3 managed to, I dunno, program it into the Moment somehow? It'd be kind of inconvenient tripping over time-frozen people all the time."[/k]

"Maybe but... it's just last night I had a thought and it made me... I don't know."

[k]"What was your thought?"[/k]

"Well, I was lying there in bed right? And -"

[k]"Wait, Bina. Is this a thought that I [i]want[/i] to hear about?"[/k]

"What?"

[k]"Well, it's a 'lying in bed thought' right? So, well, I'd say a good [i]quarter[/i] of your journals are just you complaining about how you can't get laid here, so I'm not entirely sure I want to hear about-"[/k]

"WHAT!?"

[k]"Well, ok, maybe not a [i]quarter[/i] it's more like a [i]fifth[/i] or -"[/k]

"THERE IS SEX STUFF IN MY JOURNALS?!"

[k]"Well [i]yeah[/i]. You would know this if you had [i]read[/i] any of them."[/k]

"AND YOU'VE BEEN READING THEM!?"

[k]"You said it was ok! And I try to skip past those sections-"[/k]

"Aaaah!"

[k]"- but you're not very good at content siloing. Like, there are a lot of situations where there will be a section on, like, amplitude-to-paradox conversion equipment which will just sort of segue in, like, [i]one sentence[/i] into you talking about how you really want to-[/k]

"AAAAAAAAAAAAH! I cannot believe this is happening!"

[img]0766_b.png[/img]

[k]"Hey, it's not as bad as it could be. There was a while there where I thought that 'Lash' was, like, actually a [i]whip[/i]."[/k]

"Oh gods."

[k]"So when you were talking about how much you missed 'Lash', I was like 'Woah, I didn't think she was a nun, but Bina is [i]way[/i] more kinky then I thought she was!'"[/k]

It is in this moment that Bina discovers that embarrassment is not a finite resource. There can be, given the right circumstances, [i]infinite amounts of it.[/i]

"That's it. I'm done," groans Bina. "Just kill me now..."
