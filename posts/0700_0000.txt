"What time was it when we went back?" asks Bina.

[k]"Not entirely sure,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"You woke up at like... 11:10 or so? I checked when the naughts showed up and it was 11:04. I must have broken the watch when I was moving our stuff off the roof. Sorry."[/k]

"It's ok," says Bina. "It's just a watch."

The walk some more, in silence. The mud sucks at her legs. The intense cold near the tunnel mouth fades, but it never really goes away.
