"Is that my grandmothers scarf?"

[color=#94846F]"You left it behind this time. In two pieces. I had one of them in my pocket when I - when [i]it[/i]- happened. I sent the other back to you."[/color]

A long pause. The engine's drone kicks up another notch, becomes a piercing stuttering whine.

[color=#94846F]"You needed it."[/color]

What the heck?

I barely remember that thing with the scarf. That was [i]real[/i]?

[quote="Kíeros"]> "That doesn't really explain anything."[/quote]

"You realize, that doesn't actually [i]explain[/i] anything!" I shout across to her. The engine is even louder now.

She doesn't reply.

The sky changes flickers again, but this time it doesn't change back.

I realize the grinding noise I've been hearing isn't the engine.

It's the things in the sky.

They're [i]growling[/i].

Above me, a fluffy cloud cracks open. 

Grows teeth.

This dream is [i]over[/i]. It is [i]definitely[/i] time to wake up.

But I have one last question.

[quote="tronn"]>Bina: Ask something that has been troubling you for some time - [i]how[/i] did Josephine, like, die?[/quote]

[quote="BreadProduct"]>You probably don't have a lot of time before shit hits the fan. You need to know how Josephine died. Now.[/quote]

[quote="Xander"]Bina. Ask her now. How did she die?[/quote]

[quote="badatnamesbluhbluh"]>Bina: Sorry, this is a stressful situation for both of us, but I need to know where everything went wrong.[/quote]

"Josephine!" I'm shouting again. Not angry this time, I [i]have[/i] to shout in order to be heard over the increasing noise from the hungry sky. "You have to tell me what went wrong! You [i]have[/i] to tell me how you [i]died[/i]!"
