After a few more minutes of poking and prodding, the triage nurse leaves to try to find a doctor who hasn't gone home yet. 

[k]"Hey -"[/k]

[k]"How is it?"[/k]

"Not great," says Bina. "The nurse guy keeps clucking and frowning at me."

[k]"He's a triage nurse, that's at least two thirds of his job."[/k]

"Yeah, but he wants me to get an x-ray."

[k]"Ah,"[/k] says Kendra, then trails off. [k]"That would be..."[/k]

"A fantastically bad idea?" asks Bina. 

[k]"Also dangerous,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"For like, three different reasons."[/k]

"Mmmyep, I'm goinna try to convince them to just sew my foot up. I'll deal with the other stuff once we're not busy fighting a giant bug from space."

Kendra frowns at this for a second, but eventually nods.

"How is it that [i]I'm[/i] always the one who gets hurt?" asks Bina. "Somehow, despite everything, you're doing totally OK. You [i]are[/i] OK, right?"

[k]"I have some bruises,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"And the cuts on my face - but they're mostly better now - and umm - well, Elizbeth was hit by shovel, nearly fell to her death, and then got [i]shot[/i]."[/k]

"Oh right," says Bina, remembering. "Yeah. I am a terrible person for whining."

[k]"And um, as for me - I don't know for sure, but I suspect the key factor might be that I don't do stuff like walk around supernatural subway murder scenes in my bare feet, dunk my cut-up knees in hundred year old sewage, or try to pet hostile aliens."[/k]

"That, yeah, that's a pretty good point," says Bina, and sighs.
