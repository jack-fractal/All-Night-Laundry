[quote="tegerioreo"]If that Swiffer-looking contraption behind you is the kind that squirts cleaning solution, grab it and squirt the thing til it sparkles!

Or, perhaps more usefully, jam the business end of the cleaning tool into the monster's mouth.[/quote]

Bina doesn't have any barbarian ancestors! Her ancestors were merchants! The only things they slashed were prices!

She grabs for the swiffer anyways.

She's got no leverage, the weight is all wrong. It's too heavy at the bottom, too light on top.

She barely manages to get the stock in her hands before the creature slams into her, pushing her into the wall. 

The impact is terrible, knocking the breath out of her and slamming her head into the wall hard enough to bring tears to her eyes. Her right hip screeches at her again. 

The beasts teeth crunch into the cheap plastic. Cleaning fluids spray everywhere.

It tears the swiffer from Bina's hands with one swift jerk of its head.

Oh god it doesn't want to hug her!

It going to...

Stop?

Bina freezes in a moment of distilled terror, but the teeth of the thing do not close on her neck.

Its frantic movement stills.

It is only a few inches from her face. The filthy water begins to soak through her jeans.
