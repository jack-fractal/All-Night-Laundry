It looks kinda gross to be poking about in. 

And it's clearly not viscous at all. It's just water with dirt in it. Really black dirt, like coal dust maybe, but just dirt. 

And what wonderful prize could she possibly find? That big guy's underwear? What would he think of her if he came back with his dryer sheets and found her up to her elbows in his unmentionables?

Yeah. Best to pretend none of this happened.

Bina remembers that the guy used the swiffer thing to clean up... something. What WAS he cleaning with this anyways?

Bina goes over to get it and realizes that, of course, there's no little washy pad thing on it. She remembers noticing that while she was putting her washing in.

Ah well. That guy will have to clean it up himself when he comes back. 

Hhhheuuuugh.... wow, she's dead tired. 

[img]0018_e.gif[/img]

Ha! You know? It's funny. She'd almost convinced herself that there'd be something horrible in that washing machine. 

Funny huh? 

She's just tired is all. Long day. Jumping at shadows. 

Heh. Time for more cooki -

Suddenly there is a loud noise from within the washing machine.

A wet, sloshing, thud.

Bina freezes.

A noise repeats itself. Louder. The washing machine bucks under the impact, and dirty water sloshes onto the floor.
