"I did these bandages too fast, the tapes all wrong," mutters Melissa. "I'll redo them when you're back in bed."

[quote=tegerioreo;7902111]Group:  Get Bina to bed.

Bina: Protest weakly.[/quote]

[k]"Mel? Can you get Bina a wheelchair? She looks really tired and I don't want her to fall or anything on the way down the hall."[/k]

Bina starts to say, "I'm fine!" but Kendra squeezes her shoulder hard and cuts her off.

"Right, good idea," says Melissa. "I'll grab one from emerge. Be back in a second."

[k]"We're not going anywhere,"[/k] says Kendra.

"You'd better not be," says Melissa in a tone that promises infinite suffering for those who disobey.

[k]"Hey, Emmie, wait."[/k]

Kendra jumps up and half runs to catch up with him.

"Yes?"

Oh gosh, thinks Bina feeling herself start to blush, they're even [i]cute[/i] together. This is not fair.

[k]"Um... just, thanks. I'm sorry for, um, all this."[/k]

"It is my pleasure. I don't know what is going on, but I know you and I know your sister. Neither of you would be doing this without a good reason."

[k]"Huh, yeah."[/k]

"Of course," says Emmie with a grin, "I would not [i]oppose[/i] an explanation, should you find the time."

With that he vanishes into the gloom and Bina realizes that she and Kendra are alone for at least a few minutes.

[k]"We gotta talk fast before my sister gets back,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"This plan of yours not to tell anyone what's going on? It really sucks!"[/k]

Hope I managed to format this right. Oh bbcode, it's been a while.[/spoiler]

Binged this entire thing a few nights ago instead of studying. Gave in and made an account to make tracking it easier. I'm a sucker for time shenanigans.[/quote]

Hey! Thanks for reading and thanks for the spelling correction! I would be very happy if you stuck around. This is a fun place.
