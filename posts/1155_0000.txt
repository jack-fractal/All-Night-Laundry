"You, should shoot him, now!" says Bina. "Sorry," she looks at Gregor. "You're significantly more lucid then I thought you would be [i]but still![/i]"

Gregor just shrugs at this while Elizabeth, again, ignores her.

[e]"You ok kid?"[/e] she asks, out of the corner of her mouth.

"What!? [i]No![/i] Of course I'm not ok! What are you [i]doing?[/i]"

[e]"You're under arrest!"[/e] says Elizabeth, to Gregor. [e]"For... well a whole bunch of stuff, kidnapping for sure, and also the murder of two as yet unnamed police officers."[/e]

"All riiight," says Gregor, drawing out the syllables.
