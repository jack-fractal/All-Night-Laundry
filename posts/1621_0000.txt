"So wait..." asks Bina, as Amie starts losing a bit of steam.

... this Kendra person, is she hot?"

>>>NOTES:

OK, so this was originally going to be an image of the Monteral Olympic Stadium, which is where this scene is set (well done gailal!).

But! It turns out... I can't actually do that, legally. Maybe. It's kind of up in the air right now, I think?

Tonight, while looking for reference images, I ran into this bizarre story from [url=http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/olympic-stadium-image-off-limits-to-t-shirt-designer-1.3087853][i]last year[/i][/url] about the architect of this financial disaster suing people using [i]drawings[/i] of the building on t-shirts.

I'm pretty careful about what references I use. When I can, I take my own photographs. This time I couldn't, because I wanted a nice aerial shot and I don't have a drone, so I was trying to figure out how to buy some images from ghetty, but then I found this...

I don't make money from All Night Laundry, and this is not a particularly popular webcomic, the ownership rights are all over the place because I use your suggestions, names, and sometimes art as parts of the text... but I would prefer to err on the side of caution. I think it would be a new low in my life to be sued over something as daft as this. 

So... enjoy the pictures of clouds. They are not as pretty as the one I was planning on making.

PS: Copyright law is a ongoing cultural disaster and needs to be fundamentally reworked.
