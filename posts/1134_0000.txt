>>>NOTES:

[quote=sequintial]1) It's really been interesting seeing all the different styles in this! I started a couple weeks ago and read it all in a couple days, just now decided to pipe up.
2) kudos to being spooky as shit while still letting me sleep at night, seriously well done[/quote]

I'm glad you could sleep at night. I don't think I've really [i]scared[/i] people successfuly with this, it's too long and the interactivity kind of makes pacing tricky, but spooky. I do like my spooky.
