What's happened occurs to Bina all at once, in a flash. There's no piecing together of information, she just knows, immediately, what's happened. 

The crazy portal she opened... it opened here in reverse, cutting through the floor, throwing off their timing.

It would be fine, the time machine above, the one that should catch Elizabeth, is rigged with proximity sensors.

It will activate properly.

But it needs unlight to work -

- and she's not holding the flashlight.

She grabs for it.
