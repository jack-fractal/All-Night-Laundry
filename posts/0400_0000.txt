[quote="Fuade"]At least look inside it first.  Chances are the glove box is smooshed shut and encased in metal[/quote]

[k]"I don't know if we can even get in there, it's probably been crushed shut."[/k]

[quote="karishi"]Check out the source of light on the other side of the truck.  If it's mobile, bring it around.  Some defense is better than none, but a clear view of where all the glass is will protect your arms better than anything short of chainmail.[/quote]

"Its too dark to be sure, but I [i]think[/i] it's intact. Maybe I could - "

[k]"No!"[/k] says Kendra as Bina reaches for the bandages on her hand, [k]"Not your spooky arm light. You said it before, every time you use it, things go bad."[/k]

"It's not as cold over here. I don't think this area is as badly off as the place near the tunnel."

[k]"Even so, lets try to find a regular old flash-light or something instead, huh?"[/k]

"Yeah ok, probably a good idea."

[quote="BreadProduct"]If you see a dead Bina in the drivers seat, try not to freak out, k?[/quote]

"You ok?"

[k]"No, I'm fine. It's just - I hope nobody was in that truck when it fell."[/k]

"I... uh... I doubt it collapsed super fast. The driver probably had a chance to jump out and get clear before it fell."

They walk in silence for a few seconds.

[k]"Are you just saying that to make me feel better?"[/k]

"Yeah, kinda."

[k]"Thought so."[/k]

"It would have been a nasty way to die."

[k]"Come on, lets checkout this open air tent."[/k]
