>>>NOTES:

There are some times where you get a command and you spend all day giggling about how incredibly awesome it is. This was one of those time. Thank you BreadProduct. Thank you so much. I really had fun with this one. Your idea wasn't stupid, it was awesome. It just wouldn't work here. 

I know everyone really wants them to do the phone thing, and they WILL, I just [i]had[/i] to use this one. It was so amazing.
