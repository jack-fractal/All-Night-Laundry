Amie can just say she's going to practice. 

Bina will understand. Totally. She's pretty understanding as far as roommates go. Unless she's like... getting naked with someone... in the living room... in the middle of the day.

[quote=Dave]For the 1000th day, every adventure author who reads ANL should recreate that update (or a panel from that update) HSHS style. It might be neat to see the same scene recreated in like a dozen different art styles.

(hopefully I don't have to recreate Amie's hair in LEGO, I'm pretty sure it doesn't exist :woeful:)[/quote]

[quote=xooxu;7886588]That would be hella cool.[/quote]

That is a cool idea but man, I dunno if I can ask you all to do that. 

I like the basic idea though. Oh! Hmm... what if everyone who wanted, drew [i]their[/i] characters doing their laundry, and if you did [i]that[/i], it entered you in, like, a random draw?
