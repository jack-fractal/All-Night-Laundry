[quote=BreadProduct]>Uh hello what if they are the two police officers?[/quote]

[k]"Heyyy... I just had a really bad thought."[/k]

"What?"

[k]"What if it was... you know..."[/k]

"You think it's them?"

[k]"Maybe?"[/k] asks Kendra. [k]"Does that work? Is there a way that works? That's the kind of thing that [i]would[/i] happen."[/k]

"Oh! Time travel?" asks Amie. "Is this more time travel?"

"Yeah, time travel," says Bina, thinking.

"Time travel?" asks Emmie, a little faintly. 

[k]"Iiiit's complicated,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"We'll explain soon, right? Soon."[/k]

"I don't... think it's them," says Bina. "I can't remember exactly what Gregor said but he was [i]told[/i] to go there, he was bragging about knowing where to be, how he knew exactly what to do, but that doesn't work anymore, right? We're off script."
