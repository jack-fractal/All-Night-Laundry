[quote="Lacemaker"]I wonder what the numbers mean. Latitude and longitude? That second one could be an old temperature reading, maybe. Some other scientific recording? A marker of water depth? Trail marker?[/quote]

"What do you think the numbers mean? Mud height? Temperature?"

[k]"They're printed, not written, that suggests that they're not a measurement. They might be a location."[/k]

"Yeah, maybe. Its as good a guess as any."

[k]"They had plastic in 1911, right?"[/k]

"I [i]think[/i] so. I admit the history of plastic isn't really something I've spent a great deal of time researching."

[k]"A [i]grave[/i] oversight in your education."[/k]

"You know, up 'till now, it never really came up."

[k]"What [i]are[/i] they teaching young people these days?"[/k]

"Well me, I'm majoring in sarcasm," says Bina. "With minors in flower arrangement, spite, and decorous behavior."

[k]"Decorous behavior?"[/k]

"It means, like, acting properly and appropriately to the situation. Being humble. That kind of thing."

[k]"I know what 'decorous behavior' means. What I don't understand is how it in any way applies to you.[/k]

"Well, to be fair, I'm failing that class."

Kendra snorts.

"Do you want your stick back or not?"
