[k]"Hey! Bina!"[/k] Kendra's voice is a hiss. [k]"You're not falling asleep are you?"[/k]

"Mnnnoo... mm'just," she yawns, "resting. Just for a second..."

[k]"Seriously?"[/k]

"Just resting!"

[k]"Crap. You can't - crap..."[/k]

There's some rustling noises.

[k]"Hey. Hey!"[/k]

Kendra looks really sad. Bina wishes she would smile more. She bet's that Kendra has a nice smile.

[k]"Hey! Get it together! You can't go to sleep! Not now! You probably have a concussion!"[/k]

"S'your fault. You hit me with a phone!"

[k]"I know! Sorry, look, we should run now right, or go back through time? We shouldn't BE here! Isn't the big dog thing about to show up?"[/k]

Hmmm? What's she talking about? The doggy went smoosh... right? S'maybe not dead, but it got crushed by a [i]building[/i]. Goinna take a while to dig itself outta that!

Kendra's beeing... *yawn*... silly...
