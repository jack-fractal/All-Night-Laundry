[k]"Good god, Bina, are you somehow down here in your bare feet?"[/k]

"Nooooo?"

[k]"How did you manage this?"[/k]

"I just had the Hello Kitty socks and then they got all full of time goo so I took them off and -!"

[k]"Right,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"Of course you did. Well, be careful with your feet because, you know, this is sharp gravel down here, I guess. God dammit!"[/k]
