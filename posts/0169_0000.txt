>>>NOTES:

So... did not get the retcon update done tonight. I really debated staying up later to finish it, but I am exhausted. I hadn't decided yet if I'd add the retcon updates to my self-imposed ironman update-every-day thing... and I think I'm [i]not[/i] going to do that. So I may slip occasionally on the retcon updates when I do things like stay after work for four hours to play the Game of Thrones board-game with my co-workers.

So there's one more non-interactive update, then we should be back to normal levels of interactivity. While updating daily works better for me as an author, it does make this weird as an adventure, with these not-very-interactive-at-all sections.
