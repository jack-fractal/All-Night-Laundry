>>>NOTES:

And I totally lost track of the book! I've gone back and edited it into the other pages because it's too important a game piece to vanish into the ether like that.

Also Hi BowenThe Kotoc! Thank you for all your edit comments! I'm glad you finally made it to the present! :)

Your theories are... interesting.
