[quote="Crowstone"]why is there wind INSIDEEEE[/quote]

That is a... good question. A clear breeze starts to blow, the air is twisting around her somehow, playing with some of the loose strands of her hair. Nothing else in the room seems to feel the strange breeze. The stacks of paper are silent. The leaves of the experimental beets are entirely still.

She feels the hair on her arms and legs stand on end, and realizes that it's not fear doing it, or rage, or nerves, or anything like that. It's something else. Static electricity. There is a strange feeling in the air, a hum, but not heard with the ears. It is like standing next to an electrical generator.

Oh bugger. Something funny is happening again isn't it?
