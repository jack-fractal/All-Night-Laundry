"I asked you a question."

"Would you believe time travel?" asks Bina, from somewhere at ground level.

Amie, for her part, appears to be fighting another battle against the pizza she ate, with mixed results. 

[k]"My friend is delerious from loss of blood,"[/k] says Kendra, quickly. [k]"We need to get her to the hospital, which is why we are here. Because of the hospital. Which we are going to. Now."[/k]

[quote="Tegerioreo"]Pretend you don't know what's going on! It shouldn't be hard.[/quote]

[k]"We don't know anything about whatever... is... this."[/k]

Kendra kicks herself mentally, several times, very hard. 

Thankfully, it appears that the police officer speaking to them is having a very bad day and so he decides to categorize them as 'Idiots I don't want to have to deal with.'

"God dammit," swears the police officer who spoke before. "This whole situation is a shitshow!" He makes one short violent hand gesture at the elderly man with him. "Get them outta here! Make sure they don't step on anything important."
