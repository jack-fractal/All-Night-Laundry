[k]"What is that?"[/k]

"It's a backpack."

[k]"I can see [i]that[/i], but where did it come from?"[/k]

"It's from a friend. I'll explain later."

[quote=loneVision;7501904]>Ooh take the thingy![/quote]

[quote=Lacemaker;7502082]Indeed, take the thingy. Examine backpack for delicious goodies and/or dangerous explosives. Possibly fuzzy pink handcuffs, depending on the type of thing you would/ will have already left for yourself.[/quote]

[quote=Dalmationer;7502487]>Grab the backpack, it's loaded up with things and knick knacks too. Anything that you might need it's got inside for you.[/quote]

Bina goes to the backpack and without taking it down, unzips the front compartment. That's where she'd put anything that she knew they needed immediately.

And her magical gift from the future is...

Cleaning supplies? Of course it is. Bina makes a mental note to buy herself something REALLY nice as a present when she gets out of all this. All her presents to herself recently have suuuucked.

She's going to assume these are for the writing. 

"Get the other stuff! I'll clean the wall."

Bina scrubs at the writing while Kendra gathers up the box of kleenex, the paper bag, and the piece of time.

A huge blast of green light from under the door signals the departure of past-her! The hound is now free to do whatever it wants. She tries to convince herself that the growing tension she feels is some kind of sign of time getting ready to spring back into shape, and not just regular old 'there is a monster nearby and I am concerned that it might eat me' anxiety and nerves. 

She is only partially successful.

[k]"Got them!" says Kendra, [k]"Are you sure this is going to work?"[/k]

"Haha! No! Of course not!"

[k]"How very reassuring."[/k]

"You're welcome!" says Bina, "OK. That's the writing gone! Is there ANYTHING else?"

In the laundromat there is a another crash, and a scraping sound. Then the sound of scrabbling claws. Now is really the time to go. 

[k]"No, this is everything. There's just the backpack, and I guess the nail it's hanging on."[/k][/k]
