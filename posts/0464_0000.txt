"I'm not jumping 'till YOU jump. Come on!"

[k]"Oooh god. Not fair!"[/k]

[quote=Kíeros;7650501]> How close are you to the metal now?[/quote]

"How close do you think we can get?"

[k]"Not much closer! We don't want to hit it!"[/k]

"Just remember to [i]climb down[/i] when you grab the scaffolding. I don't want to smack into you and make us both fall. OK? Climb [i]down[/i] when you grab on. I'll be two swings behind you."

[k]"Oh god, I really don't want to die."[/k]

"Then don't! You can do this. You barely have to jump. Just reach out and grab it! Come on! I'm right behind you."

[k]"Ooooh god. Ooooh god."[/k]

Kendra jumps, right at the apogee, but it's impossible to hold the flash-light steady and Bina loses track her instantly in the dark as the gondola whips away.

[quote=curiousTerminal;7650591][quote=Xander;7650461]I'm comparing two different angles here, but if I'm right, with the way they're swinging, they should be smashing against the metal by now.[/quote][img]http://i.imgur.com/9tHmP8H.gif[/img]

The thing they're swinging towards is in the red, they've got quite a ways to go before they're within jump distance, let alone banging into it.[/quote]

Well spotted curiousTerminal! 

The perspective here is a bit hash. We probably shouldn't be able to see the front of the bio-tent, as this is supposed to be slightly over 90 degrees to the right from the previous view of this scene.

I'm fudging spacial relationships a bit here because I wanted to be able to show them swinging.

Thanks Zylo! That is super nice of you to say!
