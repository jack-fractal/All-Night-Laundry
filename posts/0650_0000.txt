[quote="taciturnPanthera"]> Also, what's that sketchy thing on the fallen washer? I can't quite figure it out.[/quote]

[k]"Is that a - is that a... disembowelled mop?"[/k]

"It's a swiffer." says Bina, "You know, the mops thingies with the disposable cleaning pads? Spooky MacRussianPants used it to clean up some blood - [i]my[/i] blood I think - from when you hit me with the phone."

[k]"I am [i]really[/i] sorry about that, you know?"[/k]

"It's ok. I think going to a dentist after all of this is going to be the least of my worries." says Bina. She's trying for flippant but she doesn't quite make it. "So then I tried to use it to hold off the enormous and evil version of Piotyr, the first time I saw her."

[k]"That... doesn't seem to have gone very well."[/k]

"Not so much, no. She crawled out of that washing machine over there."

There's a pause as they both stare at the thing.

"We should go, right?" asks Bina, "We should go."

[quote="Kíeros"]> Should there still be a gaping hole behind you?[/quote]

[k]"What about this?"[/k] asks Kendra, raising her hands and gesturing at the enormous gaping hole in the wall. 

[quote="SNORKELBITCHMEGAHITLER"]Uhhm so it seems that space has been cracked open......is that......is that supposed to happen?[i][/i][/quote]

[k]"Does that just stay there?"[/k]

"Err... I don't remember it doing that before. I don't really remember [i]landing[/i] before. I was falling, and then I was wherever I was going."

[k]"So the enormous hole in the wall, that's new?"[/k]

"Yes. New [i]and[/i] disturbing."

[k]"Greeeeeat..."[/k]

"Could it be the time machine doing that? We haven't travelled by time machine before. Just by brick and by accident."

[k]"It's not exactly subtle if it is."[/k]

"Maybe we're the only ones who can see it?"

[quote="BreadProduct"]Say, what's that red stuff?[/quote]

[k]"Maybe... hmm what do you suppose [i]this[/i] is?"[/k]

[quote="K25fF"]Is that the SCERF, lodged in the portal?[/quote]

[k]"Looks like some kind of fabric? It's sort of looped around the hole here."[/k]

[quote="taciturnPanthera"]Woo, caught up! Well, technically I caught up last weekend but I was on a time crunch and didn't have time to comment...so...woo, caught up again? :cheer: Took me about three weekends and far too many mutterings of "I should [i]not[/i] be reading this so late at night", but it was worth every bit of it :D[/quote]

Aaah! Thank you for reading and your nice words! I am always really happy when someone catches up. :pleasant:
