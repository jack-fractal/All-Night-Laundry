Kendra's heart almost jumps out of her chest as she feels something grab her arm. 

[quote="2Cre@te"]> Good things: start happening again. Mainly, Bina reaching Kendra, the trio retreating into the Moment and Elizabeth getting some help.[/quote]

"Kendra!"

"I'm fine. I made it!"

Bina's face looks ghastly in the green light, streaked with sweat, but she's here, again, despite the impossibility. 

Kendra wonders how many more times she's going to be able to pull something like that off. 

Watching Bina do what she does is a lot like watching someone dancing on the edge of a knife. 

"Lets get the hell out of here!"
