[e]"Hey!"[/e]

They look up.

"Hey!"

[e]"There's a latch!"[/e]

"A what?"

[e]"A LATCH! On the gondola! You have to sort of wiggle it."[/e]

"OK!"

[e]"Make sure it's CLOSED before you start moving!"[/e]

"Right!"

[e]"And don't hit any of the BUTTONS! I'll do it from up here!"[/e]

"OK!"

Bina wiggles the latch. It pops open with a heavy thunk. 

[quote="Kíeros"]> Well, get in. It can't go badly now.[/quote]

They both step inside.

"Did we ever get her name?"

[k]"I don't think so."[/k]

"We should get her name."

[k]"Oohhhkay.'[/k]

Bina steps back outside and shouts, "Hey! What's your name?!"

[e]"What?"[/e]

"I [i]asked[/i], WHAT'S your NAME?"

[quote="TobiasMoon"]Team: Gain a third party member[/quote]

[e]"Elizabeth!"[/e]

"Hi Elizabeth!" 

[e]"Hi! Can you get on now?"[/e]

"Sure!"

[quote="Lacemaker"]Gondola: be frighteningly rickety.[/quote]

[e]"Don't move too much!"[/e]

"What?"

[e]"Don't move around too much! There's no guide-wires! If you move around too much it'll [i]swing[/i]. That's BAD!"[/e]

"Oh! Right! OK!" 

Bina gets inside and closes the latch. 

She leans out and shouts, "We're good! You can move us now!"

There are several seconds pause and then, with a lurch, the gondola starts moving upward.

[k]"So, I'm guessing that this is the point where I should mention that I have a little thing about [i]heights[/i]?"[/k]
