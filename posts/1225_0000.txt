"Hold for the Director of Operations..." 

Another click and Bina has time to wonder what kind of phone system they're running this operation on, it sounds like something from a 1950's spy drama, and then, without warning, there another voice on the line.

"Bina Miryala?" it asks. It is an old voice, a throaty voice, a smoker's voice, and a woman.

"Yes."

"Bina Miryala, the time traveller?"

She hesitates, but only for a moment. 

"Yes," says Bina Miryala the time traveller, and knows that whatever hope she had for a regular future has just flown off, vanished, possibly forever. 

"Good," says the voice.

"How can we help you?"

>>>NOTES:

[quote="Chaz Wallace"]found this comic about a week ago, took me that long to read all of it. absolutely love this.

but instead of saying this a couple posts back i decided to make a suggestion, and then today one of them got used, twice. that made me ever so happy, and made what was a long night at work much better. (was on lunch when i read this strip.)

only thing i hope, is that when we reach the "end" that you'll continue a little ways and wrap up how everyone is, settles down etc after everything is finally over. too many comics end the wrap up with only a couple pages, no real details just a they got married lived happily ever after. I feel you'll probably do more than just that and examine the aftereffects of the trauma, how the relationships hold up or fall apart etc.[/quote]

Hi Chaz! Thank you reading and for posting and well done on remembering the code word! I'm glad I could brighten your day.

I don't intend on ducking out too quickly at the end of all this. I want a proper denouement as well, though it will almost certainly be non-interactive.

[quote="Magic hobo"]Hooray, I had a slight influence on the comic![/quote]

You did! Thanks!
