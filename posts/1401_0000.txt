[quote="xooxu"]Amie. At least tell me you agree that she needs to be ... isolated. Put back where she belongs. Taken to a place where both she and humanity are out of danger. Right? Not just given what she thinks she wants. You said yourself. She's a baby. She doesn't know what's best for her yet.[/quote]

Yeah of course! She shouldn't be [i]hurting[/i] people but she doesn't know what she's doing, probably. 

That's the problem, they don't know anything [i]about[/i] her really, they just have like... suspicions and rumours, and stuff that Gregor has said - and Gregor is [i]bonkers[/i].

[quote="Zark"]How the heck did she get Gregor's watch? Or is it just one that looks a lot like it?[/quote]

That had been easy.

Unavoidable even, sort of. 

After Bina deactivated the time machine in the basement everything had been crazy for a while. People running around, doctors and patients yelling, nobody had any idea what was going on, and then the police had arrived, and had hauled Gregor away and then...

She couldn't [i]leave[/i] it.

[i]Anyone[/i] might have picked it up.

[quote="Kaliya"]Hey Zach, quick question unrelated to this panel:
How do you pronounce "Bina"?
is it "Bee-na" or "By-na"[/quote]

I have been pronouncing it "Bee-nah" but I don't speak Telugu so I may have the pronunciation incorrect.
