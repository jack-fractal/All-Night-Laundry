[k]"What -"[/k]

"I think we have to go to the lab."

[k]"What?"[/k]

"Her lab. Josephine lab! The one I saw when I went back in time."

"Maybe, yeah, but I think it's where the Moment is. I mean, I can't know for sure, but if I were going to hide something important, I think - I mean - that's where [i]I'd[/i] put it."
