"Holy crap," whispers Bina.

[quote=ForestGardener]I count 4 naughts[/quote]

[k]"Yeah, this is a bit less subtle than I expected,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"There's four naughts. That's about four more then I feel comfortable wrangling with."[/k]

[quote=ForestGardener]one of which has a captive[/quote]

"That one has a captive!" says Bina, pointing at one of the naughts disappearing into the distance.

[k]"There was another one with someone before, but you can't see it now. Looks like they're taking them somewhere."[/k]

"No points for guessing where," mutters Bina. 

They watch for a few moments in silence. The naught carrying the captive disappears into the distance. 

"Is Gregor... eating a sandwich?"

[k]"Looks like it."[/k]

"Jerk," says Bina, who, with a sinking feeling when her stomach takes that moment to gently point out that she hasn't had solid food in three days. "Damn, now I'm hungry."

[k]"Me too,"[/k] says Kendra.

"He hasn't seen us yet."

[k]"Does he need too?"[/k] asks Kendra. [k]"The naughts would bring us here either way. Either they get us, and bring us as captives..."[/k]

"Or we follow the captives and come ourselves," finishes Bina. "Like we did. Great."

[k]"Yeah."[/k]

"Your sister! Have you-"

[k]"No,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"Not yet."[/k]

"OK," says Bina, not knowing what else to say. "How did he [i]do[/i] this? Since when can Gregor time travel? Where did he get the unlight?"

[k]"Don't know about that last one,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"But I know how he made the rift."[/k]

"How?"

[quote=smurfton]Oh snap completely didn't realize that was a time machine[/quote]

[k]"He's got [i]my[/i] bloody time machine!"[/k]
