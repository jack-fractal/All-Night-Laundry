[quote="Lacemaker"]So what are you up to, Kendra? Are you trying to find Bina, specifically B13?[/quote]

She's not looking for her right now. The point of this whole endeavour is to put some distance between them. 

[quote="The One Guy"]> So where is your destination?[/quote]

The tent she was in before. The one with all the corpses. 

They find themselves in terrible need of [i]directions[/i]. Finding your way to the camp is easy. It's the only visible landmark. Even with the lights out, it's got a giant hole in the ceiling. 

It's hard to miss.

But navigating the rest of this mess is a nightmare of twisted alleys, impassible piles of junk, and collapsed buildings.

So Kendra is here to pilfer them some maps. 

[i]That[/i]... and Kendra really wants to grab the x-ray.

Kendra wishes that she'd had some way to test Bina's theory earlier.

Specifically, she wishes she'd had some way to test it [i]before[/i] walking into a tent containing like... two dozen actual bodies of genuinely real dead people.

Because if the fearless little nut-ball is [i]wrong[/i] about all this, things are about to get [i]really[/i] interesting [i]really[/i] fast.
