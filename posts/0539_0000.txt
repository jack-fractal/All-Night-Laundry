"And one piece of time from about two and a half hours ago."

[k]"This seems... maybe insufficient if we're going to build a time machine."[/k]

"Hah! Yeah. I think we're going to need to find more, you know, electrical stuff. I don't think the flash-lights will be enough."

[k]"You mean we can't build a time machine out of expended hand-warmers and a granola bar?"[/k]

"I'm thinking probably no."

[k]"Children's television has lied to me again!"[/k]

>>>NOTES:
>>>EDITOR_COMMENTS: Page 855 tells us that the piece of time was from 6:15 AM; Page 568 tells us that Kendra finished the time machine at 8:50 AM and that Bina had left to distract the naughts 35 minutes previous to that, which means that the piece of time is closer to two and a half hours old at this point.
