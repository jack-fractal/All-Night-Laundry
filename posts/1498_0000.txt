[k]"I'm glad I was wrong about it being the unDog we'd bring with us."[/k]

"Yeah, that coulda gone [i]real bad,[/i]" says Bina. "Though Man and Dog not showing themselves does make me a little nervous."

[k]"They were probably there, watching."[/k]

"You think Gregor was hiding? He doesn't hit me as a hiding kinda guy."

[k]"We got two outta three things we wanted. I call that a win,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"You [i]did[/i] get the damned life raft, right?"[/k]

"Yup! The wall just needed a little axe surgery."

[k]"All right then."[/k]

"What in the heck are you two talking about!?" yells Amie. "You planned that!? With the naughts? How!?"

"With time travel?" croaks Emmie, then spits. "I thought -"

"Nope!" says Bina. "Look, don't worry about it too much. Like Kendra said, we're here, we have the life-raft, and we have no hangers-on this time, undead or otherwise. Gregor's naught army's PTP is down at the dig site and we're somewhere with no sewers. So, over all, I'm going to give that little excursion a solid B+. It went pretty well!"

Emmie coughs, significantly. 

"Oh, yeah... Uhhh... C- then?"

"Sure," says Emmie, spitting again. "Lets go with that."
