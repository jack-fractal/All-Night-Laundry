"You know the wigglies are going to try to get in as soon as I turn this thing on, right?"

[k]"We don't know that for sure."[/k]

"Yeah but - 

[k]"But it's a good guess,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"I think I have all the ways in blocked, but I'll try to be quick."[/k] 

She breathes out then rolls her shoulders. [k]"Come on, lets do this before I lose my nerve."[/k]

"Oh! Right! - Wait."

[k]"What?"[/k]

"I just want to - I mean - I - look, if we're going to do this..."

Crap! 

Bina started this sentence with the best of intentions, but it's running away on her. 

Sentence fragments babble out, nothing connecting. "You just spent - like, I mean - I went to sleep and you spent like two hours protecting me from monsters, alone, and you built a time machine and you didn't even mention how weird the journal is and - I'm just this crazy girl you met and - look - even if this doesn't work..."

She trails off. 

Kendra looks at her.

She will not blush. She won't. 

The silence stretches. Kendra starts to say, [k]"Uuhh -[/k]

She can't leave it like that! She cuts her off, "You're kind of amazing. OK? I'm just saying."

She can't look at Kendra.

"Come on! Lets do this!"

>>>NOTES:

Sorry for the lack of interactivity over the last few days. I know everyone just wants to GET TO THE TIME TRAVEL DAMMIT, and I do too, but the limits of time and energy means that I can't just jump right there in one update. Too many panels, too much to draw. 

It will be one or two more days of ==>.
