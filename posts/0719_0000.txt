"I guess," says Bina. "But I'm not very good at communicating with myself at the best of times."

[k]"Don't think about it that way. Just ask yourself, if you were going to send something important to yourself, where would you put it?"[/k]

"Here."

"What?"

[k]"Did you hear something?"[/k]

"No."

[k]"[i]I[/i] heard something."[/k][/size]
