[quote=Zephyr]> KENDRA YOU COMFORT THAT GIRL THIS INSTANT[/quote]

[k]"You're not disgusting. Come here. Sit. No. [i]Sit.[/i] You're going to be ok. We'll figure it out. We're going to be fine. We will figure this out."[/k]

"I'm sorry! I'm so sorry Kendra!"

[k]"You've never seen anyone die before, have you?"[/k]

[size=10]"No... not, like, for real."[/size]

They stay like that. 

Eventually, Bina says, "I... have an idea you aren't going to like much."

[k]"Hmm?"[/k]

[img]0460_b.png[/img]

[k]"Well, I don't like [i]anything[/i] much about this situation."[/k]

"I know, but you're [i]really[/i] going to hate this."

[k]"If it gets us out of here before Gregor figures out how to get control of the crane, I am willing to try anything."[/k]

"Well, we could, you know what Eliz - what she was saying? Before we went up? About how we shouldn't move around much 'cause it might make the gondola swing?"

[k]"Uh huh."[/k]

"Well... we could do that... we could swing the gondola."

[k]"You are right, I am not liking this idea."[/k]

[quote="AweshumeT"]Swing the gondola. Then slide down the other rope(coil)[/quote]

"And then we could... like... grab those power lines and climb down."

[k]"You think that would work?"[/k]

"Nnnoo? You [i]don't[/i] think it would work?"

[k]"Well... what if you missed?"[/k]

"Err."

[k]"Or what if the line snapped? Or came unplugged?"[/k]

"OK you have a point."

[k]"And those lines are [i]wet[/i] and one of them is [i]broken[/i], so even if you got down you'd run the risk of getting electrocuted or - [/k]

"OK! OK! I'm sorry I suggested it!"

There is another long pause.

Kendra figits for a few moments and then appears to start saying something several times, but stops herself before she gets the words out.

"What?"

[k][size=10]"We could [i]jump[/i]."[/size][/k] Kendra barely breathes the word.

"I told you, Eliza - 

[quote="Anomaly"]Try to land in the mud. That should cushion your fall.[/quote]

[quote="obsidalicious"]I can't quite remember the layout of the place, but is it possible to land in the mud. That should cushion your fall a bit, and this time, you'll be wearing hazmat suits so the toxicity isn't an issue this time.[/quote]

[k]"No! I mean, we could do what you were saying. We could... we could swing the gondola until it was out over the mud and [i]then[/i] jump. Force is mass times acceleration. That means the force from a fall is [i]inversely[/i] related to the length of deceleration."[/k]

"Kendra, I don't really - 

[k]"It's not that complicated. You land on something hard, deceleration is really short. Lots of force. You land on something soft, like, say, a meter or so of thick mud, deceleration takes longer so..."[/k]

"So, less force."

[k]"Yeah."[/k]

"The mud saved us before. In the basement. When the building collapsed. We jumped down, it wasn't this far maybe, but - 

[k]"That's what I was thinking. It could work. I'm not saying that it wouldn't hurt, especially not if we landed on something sharp, but..."[/k]

"But it could work."

[k]"It could."[/k]
