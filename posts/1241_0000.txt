"About what you said before," says the Director. "Are you suggesting that this entity is somehow interacting with people's dreams?"

There is a moment pause.

"Hello?"

Over the phone, scattered by static, Bina hears, "CJ? She stopped talking. Did we lose the connection?"

"What on [i]earth[/i]?" breaths Bina trying to see through the rain and fading light.

"You've got to be kidding me," says Bina, in a much louder voice.

"What's happening?"

"Sorry," says Bina, very quickly. "I'm going to have to call you back!"

>>>NOTES:

[quote="OddlucK"]I started reading this last week after seeing an ad at another webcomic I frequent. I have eagerly devoured every scrap of it, and find myself very slightly disappointed only in that I've actually caught up to the current page and have to wait for more. This is incredibly well done. Kudos both to you as the author and to the community who has helped you move this story in directions even you didn't foresee.

Bravo, sir. +1 reader.[/quote]

Hi OddlucK! Welcome to the present! Thank you very much and I'm glad you're enjoying yourself. 

[quote="Sleepy Savior"]I found this comic two days ago and read the whole thing. (Minus the retcons, gotta go back and reread now for those)

This is one of the greatest things I have read, i love it so much, 13/10, would and will read again, and i will definitely be trying to contribute. Please tell me you plan on selling this as a book when it's finished. Or, wait, Gifs make that tricky... Ebook maybe? I'm not sure what sellable format works with gifs. Maybe an app? Whatever form it is, i want to buy it.[/quote]

Hi Sleepy Savior! Thank you for reading! I've never gotten a 13/10 before, but I'll take it!. 

I'm not sure what I'm going to do with this once finished. I think I'll try compiling it into an app of some kind, like you suggest, because you're right, it's hard to print gifs.
