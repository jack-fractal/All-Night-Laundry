She doesn't think that's going to work.

Getting by it won't be easy either. She can't move without touching the it, and the washing-machine and the swiffer are between her and the door. Not to mention the horrible chairs. 

She decides to stays put for the moment. 

Huh, the weird, vibrating, fuzzyness around just sort of turned off. Like someone clicking off a light.

Ha ha! You know what's great? Not being dead! Bina sure thought she was dead there.

But nope! Totally not dead.

Hah. Hah hah hah! 

She has a sudden inexplicable urge to pat the things head like a dog. But no! That probably a really bad idea!

Ha! Heh... It's a good doggie!

Maybe if she just sort of edged to the side like thiiiiiis... 

You won't mind right? Bina's just going to climb over these chairs here ok? You're a niiiice doggie. You're not going to eat her right? 

Maybe Bina can find you something to fetch? Then you could go away. 

You'd like that huh? Going away?

Good boy! Good b -
