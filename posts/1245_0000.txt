She wants too, but the whole thing is over almost before begins. The Hound does not pause, she does not stagger, she does not [i]react[/i] like an animal would to the incredible noise of the impact, to the violent disorientation of half the wall falling away.

She just [i]moves[/i], with a clarity of purpose that is, in some indefinable way, horrible to watch. An avalanche in the shape of a beast.

The wall implodes, spraying choking dust and shrapnel through the room and then, not even bothering to lever her enormous girth fully into the room, the Hound reaches out -

- and, in as many heartbeats, plucks Gregor from his bed -

- and is gone.
