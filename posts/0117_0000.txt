[quote=ICan'tGiveCredit;7335486]> Bina: "why are we going in the basement?"[/quote]

Bina picks up her basket, and starts walking backwards toward the rows of dryers.

She smiles with her best waitress smile and asks, why are they going in the dirty basement? Up here is... just great! Heh. Heh heh.

Gregor seems confused, but answers that the basement is where the Green Lady lives, and the Green Lady is very lonely and sick. People must go to her so, so she can get better.

Doesn't Bina know this? 

Before Bina can answer, she hears the sound of a muffled moan from deeper in the laundromat.

The moan is followed by a thumping noise, then a scraping sound, like metal on metal.

Don't be the dog. PLEASE don't be the dog.
