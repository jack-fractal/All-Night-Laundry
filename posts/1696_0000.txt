[quote="The Green Lady"]Gregor probably wouldn't want to leave Piotyr, so maybe he didn't. If he really wanted to hide his tracks, he could've ridden Piotyr or a naught, or walked in a naught's track/had a naught walk in his, but he doesn't seem like the kind of person to take all those precautions... unless he knew he was being followed.

Right! She starts forward.

The floor boards under her feet creak ominously. 

[quote="James"]Amie> don't follow the foot prints too fast[/quote]

Also right!

Amie slows down and starts following the footsteps towards the stairs at a less 'getting heard by Gregor' pace.
