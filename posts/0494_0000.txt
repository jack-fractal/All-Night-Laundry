I've become a connoisseur of Nope gifs while working on this project. That one is good, works well, and is hilarious, but I think my favourite is the ones in this thread is the one from a52:

OK. So, to celebrate I'm going to give things away! 

The first person who PM's me gets a game of their choice (any game in the Steam library). 

The second and third person get a game from this list: 

	Breath of Death 7
	Cave Story+
	Civilization 5
	Cthulhu Saves the World
	Dead Island: Epidemic (where did I get -that- one from?)
	Long Live The Queen
	Offspring Fling
	Portal
	Puzzle Agent
	Sanctum	Snapshot
	Terraria
	Torchlight
	Valdis Story
	X-Com: Enemy Unknown

To be eligible, please put "All Night Laundry - 1000000 Views Give-away" in the title.

In the PM itself, please include your steam ID and the game that you want if you get first place. Also please list two games from the list, in the event that you get second or third place. 

If you don't have a steam account, but you know someone who does and THEY would like free games, you can send me their steam account too. 

If you don't want a video-game but just want to say hi, that's cool too.

I'll post again as soon as I have three winners. 

You are all awesome.

Hurray!
