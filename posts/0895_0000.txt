Bina clamps down on her hand, cutting off the light.

Without unlight, and with a sound like two iceburg-sized pieces of glass crashing into each other, the world comes back together again, but... [i]wrong[/i]. 

Bina's ears pop as the temperature drops forty degrees in less then a second.

Seams sigzag everywhere, perspective cracks where things stop lining up properly.

Above her, the top half of the smokestack vanishes with a tearing rushing noise and a rain of gravel.

[quote="AoshimaMichio"]Bina: Grab the glove without revealing anymore unlight. Probably good idea to run too, assuming your knees can take it.[/quote]

Bina starts to run.
