[size=10]"It's... small,"[/size] says Bina, trying to catch the tiny object with the ends of her fingers. [size=10]"And thin."

[k]"Bina, shhhh... get your arm out of there! I think there's something playing with the gate."[/k]

Bina hears it too, a thin, quavering, metallic shriek.

"Check the window. You can see the gate through there."

[k]"Fine, but you [i]stay down[/i]."[/k]

Bina pulls the object from the hole.
