"Move," says Gregor. "I am not playing anymore."

So he's still unwilling to shoot her, thinks a part of Bina's mind that's still functioning. She kind of hates that part of herself, but it's the only bit that's still working right now.

She should shoot him. She has a gun, she can do it, all she needs to do it point and fire... but no, she can feel that slithery sensation from before, the wriggling tendrils of Amie's gift. 

If she shoots, she'll miss, and she's not going to risk Kendra. She'll just have to hurt him another way.
