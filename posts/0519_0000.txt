[quote="1412"]Welp. The Green Lady has convinced Gregor to do her bidding, no matter how terrible it may be, by the logic that it will have never happened.
Of course, there's probably a big something she's not telling him.[/quote]

Neither of them say anything until he's vanished into the distance.

"So... he thinks the Botfly is just going to erase all of this?"

[k]"Maybe. It's happened before, right?"[/k]

"What? When?"

[k]"The loops. All the other Bina's? We don't know how those work, right? You haven't had another dream or something about that?"[/k]

"What? No. I dunno how it works. It didn't sound like B12 knew how it worked either when I talked too her. She sounded... I dunno, excited maybe? Nervous. Like she was about to do something dangerous."

[k]"Well that clears up any lingering fears I had that she might be a doppelgänger. Anyway, the loops, it might be Her Greenness who is doing it, right?"[/k]

"Maybe. But how do you even fight that? What if I'm winning?"

[k]"Hmm? I'm not following you."[/k]

"No! I mean, what if I'm winning every time and she just bats me back to the beginning again because I keep figuring out how to beat her?"

[k]"That... is not an option I'd considered."[/k]

"Yeah, I just - GOD! I [i]hate[/i] time travel!"

[k]"Come here. Are you ok? I was worried about you. Did you get away from all the Naughts? Are you hurt? Are you OK? You look OK. Mostly OK."[/k]

"I'm fine! Really. I mean, I got stuck in a pipe and nearly drowned a little, but I'm ok. Really."

[k]"A pipe? Why did you - [/k]

"It seemed like a good idea at the time! Really! It was scary but now I'm ok. [i]I'm[/i] ok, but why are we talking about me? You - your face -

[k]"It's nothing."[/k]

"Its not nothing! You look like you lost a fight with a mountain lion!"

[k]"I've had worse. It's just, well, Horatio's got some moves in him."[/k]

"Ummm... who's Horatio?"

[quote="tronn"]>Kendra: Explain what you were doing while "getting into it a little."[/quote]

[k]"Well... turns out your plan with the Naughts only [i]sort of[/i] worked."[/k]
