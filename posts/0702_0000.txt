[quote="musicalEmpathist"]Psssssst, a little typo here. Are you feeling alright, Jack? I don't mean to be picky and point it out, but there have been quite a few small mistakes in the past couple updates, which is unusual for you. Have you been getting enough sleep?[/quote]

Thank you musicalEmpathist. 

I... probably haven't been getting enough sleep. Not lately. I've been stressed at work, and recently I've been mostly writing these updates very late at night. 

I usually read through the updates aloud, which helps me catch awkward wording, as well as giving me a chance to check for errors, but I haven't done that the last few days. Haven't had the time.

It clearly makes more of a difference then I had thought it did, which is a good thing to know.

Thank you to everyone who is catching the errors as they pop up. You are all wonderful people. :pleasant:

And thank you everyone, again, for reading.

(or course [i]today[/i] is the day that I have an update with a grand total of two words of text...)
