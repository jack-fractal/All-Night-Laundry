OK

[quote=Sporothrix;7660493]> KICK THE DOOR OPEN WITH BOTH FEET TO KNOCK IT AWAY AND RUN!!![/quote]

OK. OK.

[quote=a52;7660518]I second this.[/quote]

OK!

Aaaaaaaaaah!

Kendra barges out the door. Half way open, the door hits something heavy.

Yielding, spongy flesh over flexible elastic bones, like a rotten cheese over a frame of tree branches. 

She feels the thing reel from the impact. Reel, yes, but not [i]fall[/i]. She'd been hoping to knock it off, whatever it used for feet, but no luck. 

But it's enough. Enough to get out, enough to get past it and run.

Got to run. Got to - 

When you are running for your life, it can be hard to remember things like [i]water[/i].

And [i]traction[/i]. 

The uncomfortable hazmat boots slip on the water covered stones and Kendra starts to fall.

Now I'm going to be haunted by your phantom comment!
