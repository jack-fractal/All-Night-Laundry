"Shut up!" says Amie.

"That's what [i]I'm[/i] saying!" says Castillo. 

"No! Shut up [i]now[/i]."

"What-"

[size=8]"Shhh! Listen,"[/size] hisses Amie.

[size=8][e]"Listen to what?"[/e][/size]

[size=8]"That."[/size]

Actually did the naughts ever growl or make any sound with their vocal cords? I can't remember.[/quote]

[size=8]"There's more than one,"[/size] whispers Edwards. [size=8]"A lot more."[/size]

[size=8]"Maybe not,"[/size] says Castillo. [size=8]"Maybe one of them has multiple mouths,"[/size] 

[size=8]"Not really makin' me feel any better there buddy,"[/size] whispers Edwards.

>>>NOTES:

So hey! In 'why didn't he do that before, I mean really' news, I have made the landing page of this website just display the latest comic rather than redirecting you to the latest page thus making it awkward and inconvenient to bookmark.

I have no idea why I thought the other way was a good idea, but hey! Fixed now. 

Better late then never. Right?

... right?

Anyway. I'm going to try to tidy up the site a little, as it's pretty basic right now, and I'd like it to be more friendly looking if/when I decide to promote it. Is there anything obvious missing aside from the landing page?

I'm a sucker for time travel stories and also the colour green, and lookie here you seem to have plenty of both of those things. Plus I really like your art, you're very good at changing styles[/quote]

Hi Soleki! I'm quite fond of time travel and the colour green as well. Thank you for reading! 

I'm always happy when people tell me they like changes in style. Every time I do one I worry I may have gone too far... like the Adventure Time one? First few pages made me think I'd made a tragic mistake.
