[quote="rockCelery"]It seems Iv'e caught up. Took me almost a week to get here but it was worth it. I found you through TV Tropes if you're still keeping track of that stuff. Keep up the good work Zach![/quote]

I shall! Glad you caught up, and I am still always interested to hear where people heard about this comic from. A [i]surprising[/i] number of people come through TVTropes. Whoever set that page up there - thank you!
