"Hey! I'm not the one who came up with the idea! Wait, no. I mean, I did, but I wasn't me at the time and - 

My head is starting to hurt.

"So which one [i]are[/i] you?"

"Thirteen. I'm B13. I think. That's what everyone else tells me anyway."

"Thirteen!?"

"Yeah, you sound surprised, is that... important?"

"Well, I just - I did not expect everything to hold together for so long. So many iterations. Everything must be held together like grand piano dangling from a spiders thread. Just a little more weight and the whole thing falls to pieces."

"Sorry, I mean, it's just... look is any of this real? This, what, this [i]sky boat[/i]? And you, are [i]you[/i] real? You don't look... the same as you did before, and up until a few minutes ago this was [i]definitely[/i] a dream."

The lady above is named Josephine Dubois. This looks like a much younger Josephine.[/quote]

Josephine gives her a funny look.

"I don't look the same?"

"Oh! Yes. I'm, what? Twenty five years old now? Maybe younger?"

"Hah. Two decades of running a sugar factory, chasing around after beet farmers, and workers. A husband, friends, all those late nights in the lab. It takes a bit out of you."

She laughs to herself, a private joke. "That's one thing they don't tell you about death."

"What?"

"It works wonders for your complexion."
