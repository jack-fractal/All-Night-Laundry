[quote=Dave Rapp]I feel like Amie's going to be disappointed. The outside of the TARDIS is so... tiny. Plain, even. And then the inside is so boring! It doesn't even have the round things![/quote]

"That's it?" asks Amie.

"It's bigger on the inside, right?" asks Amie. "'Cause otherwise I'm going to need to get [i]really serious[/i] about my diet real quick."

"Yes!" says Bina, "It's bigger on the inside, and... oh, uh -"

[quote="tinwatchman"]Oh, yeah[/quote]

[quote="Unclever title"]Definitely this.[/quote]

[quote="ForestGardener"]As I said 9 days ago, "Please keep your arms and legs inside reality at all times."[/quote]

[quote="Sky Lily"]Yes, this, I second this immediately.[/quote]

[quote="Piemur"]Ditto[/quote]
