[quote="tegerioreo"]These strange people have drugged your roommate so they can use your living room for some kind of alien/shadow government experiment!

Admittedly that doesn't make much sense, but it's aliens / the shadow government!  This is how they operate!

>Amie: Brandish cricket bat.  Demand clearer explanations, medical attention for Bina, and a general getting-out-of your apartment.[/quote]

"Hey! What's wrong with her?"

[k]"She's sick. Very sick. We're going to get her medicine."[/k]

[e]"Dying,"[/color] says the other woman. [color=#696969]"You said dying."[/e]

[k]"She's not going to die."[/k]

[e]"You [i]said[/i]-"[/e]

[k]"I said IF we don't get her help then she [i]might[/i] die. We [i]are[/i] getting her help, ergo she is not going to die."[/k]

"She isn't sick. She can't be. I just talked to her a few hours ago."

[k]"Hah."[/k]

"Hey! Don't [i]laugh[/i] at me! People don't get sick that fast! If you're hurting her-"

[k]"First thing, people do get sick that fast. Infections are nasty and they don't mess around. Second, from your perspective you might have talked to her a few hours ago, but for Bina it's been almost four days."[/k]

"What?"

[k]"I'm not lying about the time travel thing," [/k] says the tall woman without looking at Amie. She turns to the other one, [k]"I think that's all the connections. How's it look on your end?"[/k]

"What?"

[e]"Err... the light on this pylon is red now? You haven't actually told me how any of this works..."[/e]

[k]"Good, that means the capacitors are charging. I think we're ready."[/k]
