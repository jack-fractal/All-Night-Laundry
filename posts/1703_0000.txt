[quote="Sevenblazes"]Wait, the Naught's going through a hole in the ceiling. Saying "That's a hole, don't go in it!" might work. That'd stop it from climbing, but you'd still have to deal with it. Give it a new order right after that![/quote]

"That thing you're climbing through?" whispers Amie. "That's a hole, you're not allowed in it!"
