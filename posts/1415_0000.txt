[quote="Kaliya"]Bina> take responsibility for what you've said and go apologize to Amie. be willing to hear her out, but still hold onto your own points and have a calm discussion with her, rather than yelling at her.[/quote]

[quote="Liam White"]Bina: Go and apologize, and come to a compromise.[/quote]

"I should go talk to her!" says Bina.

"I wouldn't do that," says Emmie. 

"Why not!? We have to plan! I need all of you for this!"

"Yeah, but - um - you were just yelling at her?" says Emmie. Not mentioning the fact that Bina is still clenching her fists. "How 'bout you give her some time."

"But we don't [i]have[/i] time!" says Bina, trying to keep the flailing to a minimum.

"Which is why you [i]definitely[/i] shouldn't be the one to go talk to her."

[k]"Fine, [i]I'll[/i] go talk to her!"[/k] says Kendra, standing up.

"Nooo," says Emmie. "You're probably the last person she wants to talk too."

[k]"What? Why!? [i]I[/i] wasn't yelling at her."[/k]

"Because... jeeze, this is a weird situation. Does anyone else realize how weird this situation is?" 

There is a pause where Emmie gets [i]more of the stares.[/i]

"Just me then. OK. [i]Anyway[/i], I hate to armchair psychology, and I'm really unqualified for this, but well - [i]you're[/i] the Companion, and she's... [i]not[/i]?"
