[quote="xooxu"]I just learned Canadian thanksgiving is Oct 9, so happy late Thanksgiving!

(I didn't even know Canada had thanksgiving, tbh, I always thought it was a US only holiday, whoops.)[/quote]

We do, but it's not really as big a deal here? It seems big news in the states, but here it's just a holiday. 

[quote="Toastscience"]I finally caught up! I actually started reading this years ago, but I lost my bookmarks at some point and I guess I forgot about this, but boy am I glad I saw it again, I loved this way back and I still love it now, I look forward to reading the rest![/quote]

Thanks Toastscience! I'm glad you found your way back here. I have about... two comics left where that happened to me, and I always sort of am vaguely looking out for them. I am surprisingly pleased that All Night Laundry was that comic for you.

Welcome to the PTP, please stick around.
