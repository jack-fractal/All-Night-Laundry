Bina shifts position. This angle is all wrong.

This would be WAY easier if it were her LEFT hand that were trapped.

Scraping noises. A hinge. The door to the basement being opened.

Bina tries to ignore it.

Footsteps on the stairs.

She can do this. It's just metal. She can outsmart [i]metal[/i].

[k]"Come on! Really? You're just trying to scare us! Stop it! Stop! Just stop it!"[/k]

This is really, VERY tricky. WHY couldn't these be the pink fluffy kind? THEY had a safety release button.

[k]"Kid! Kid we have to go. We HAVE to g-"[/k]

>>>NOTES:

Hallo everyone! Bit of an update on the retcon, which is taking a very long time to finish because I keep not drawing it! 

It is a whopping twenty seven updates long, and I've managed to do... eleven of them. 

I will get it done, but it's going to take a while, as I have to squeeze it in around regular updates. Thanks for being patient!
