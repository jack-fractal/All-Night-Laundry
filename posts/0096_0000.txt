Bina yells at Josephine to watch out for green lights! She tries to take another breath but she's being squeezed too hard, her chest won't expand. Piotr goes rigid against her side. The wind howls, beating against them.

With no warning, the pressure, and the wind, and the noise stop. All at once.

Like turning off a lightbulb.

And Bina realizes that she is sitting in the office, in the dark.

Then her hair falls in front of her face.
