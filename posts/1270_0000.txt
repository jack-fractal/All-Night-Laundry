[k]"Uh, do you think I should hold that, the light?"[/k]

"Because of my spooky demon arm?"

[k]"Yes."[/k]

"Probably a good idea."

"Wait! Can I hold it?" asks Amie.

[k]"Really?"[/k]

"Yes!"

[k]"Fine, just hurry up."[/k]

>>>NOTES:

I know a lot of you who read this comic are sitting with fear today. Other people, cleverer people then I am, have written or spoken about this at length, but I'm finding, personally, that words are inadequate, so I will be brief. 

If you know someone who is scared or alone tonight, reach out. Today of all days, reach out. 

My dad used to tell me that the best thing you can do when times are hard, is to be kind. So be kind, to yourselves and to each other, as fiercely as you can.
