[k]"It's not exactly an un-useful thing for them to believe."[/k]

"Maybe... but I still don't feel really great about it. Like, it's not just lying to them, if they figure out we're lying maybe they won't believe someone who actually [i]is[/i] in that kind of trouble next time."

[k]"Well the alternative is that we show them your arm. It is, like I said, spectacularly convincing."[/k]

"It's also horrible, evil, and prone to causing [i]spontaneous monsters[/i]."

[k]"That is also true."[/k]

Kendra sighs.

"Are you holding up OK?"

[k]"I - yeah. Yeah, I'm all right."[/k]

Bina is not sure she believes her. Now that her sister and Emmie are gone, Kendra looks very tired.

"You saved my life. Again. It's getting to be a habit."

[k]"Yeah, well... you'd do the same for me. Heck, you'd do the same for some random stranger you barely know."[/k]

[quote="badatnamesbluhbluh"]>Where's Elizabeth?[/quote]

"Where [i]is[/i] Elizabeth anyway? Back in the Moment? No, wait, that wouldn't work. Where is the [i]Moment[/i]?"

[k]"I have it here,"[/k] says Kendra patting her pocket. [k]"Elizabeth wouldn't come with us. She went back to her car to call her boss rather than come to the hospital. She's... kinda scary Bina."[/k]

"Scary? But we saved her!"

[k]"Yeah, but I don't think she gets how elaborate that was, and also, well, this is her [i]thing[/i], the whole supernatural deal. I tried to keep the details from her but that... didn't work out so great for a couple of reasons. She isn't going to be content to wait on the sidelines."[/k]

"But we [i]saved[/i] her!"

[k]"Yeah, well, maybe that doesn't matter all that much to some people."[/k]

"I don't understand, what would she do?"

[k]"I'm not sure,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"I've got Amie in the emergency waiting area watching for her and Gregor in case either of them want to make trouble."[/k]

Hey everyone! So! How 'bout that downtime? 

[quote=Dave]I dunno if the forums were down for everyone or just me (looks like they were down for everying) but I think they were down for long enough to finally break ANL's daily update streak. :distraught:[/quote]

Not quite! 

This has actually happened before, twice, and while I wasn't able to update here, I [i]did[/i] update over on my [url=http://monsterfoundry.tumblr.com/post/141014577859/in-which-bina-worries-about-her-friend]tumblr[/url].

I count that as counting, and there will be another update tonight as well.

I [i]really[/i] need to get my website up and running. Enough Dark Souls, I am getting this done.
