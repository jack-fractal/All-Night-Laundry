"Speaking of jumps," says Amie. "Did you finish your time machine?"

"Oh!" says Bina. "I wasn't awake when all that was happening. Why are you building a time machine again?"

[k]"I'm not building one,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"I'm sort of combining two of the ones we have."[/k]

"[i]Two[/i] of them?"

[k]"Yeah, one of Eleven's and one of Eight's, I think I can get them to work together if I can figure out how to make a proper seal for the paradox flywheel, but so far, no dice."[/k]

"Why do we need [i]another[/i] time machine?" asks Bina.

"'Cause the x-files nicked our good one," says Amie, then looks at Kendra for confirmation. "Right?"

[k]"And because we shouldn't be using the Moment for travel,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"It's too fragile at this point, and it's almost out of juice. We need another n-instant machine, and the only one that was remotely portable is being held by the x-files. These two together won't be quite instant, but I think I can get the ratio up pretty high."[/k]

"I could probably get them to give the other one back..."

[k]"Are you [i]sure[/i] about that? They wouldn't just grab us and make us explain things for hours?"[/k]

"Probably?" says Bina, not able to hide her doubt. "The Phenomenology people are pretty on-board with helping us, but they're not communicating very well so we could run into problems locally I guess."

"How [i]did[/i] your second chat with Her High X-Files-ey-ness go?" asks Amie

"Oh! Um... Ok," says Bina. "I asked her to turn off the internet."
