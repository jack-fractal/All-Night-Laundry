[k]"Hey, remember that time we used your spooky hand as a flashlight?"[/k]

"Yeah," says Bina. "That was like cuddling up to a nuclear reactor because you don't feel like putting on a sweater. We're not doing that again! Maybe there's a flashlight around here somewhere or one of those hard hat light things..."

[quote="xooxu"]I'm starting to think that Bina dropped her cellphone. Or has completely forgotten about it. Flashlight mode if Bina remembers it. And not with the woo woo hand.[/quote]

"Or we could just use Elizabeth's phone," says Amie. "If you still have it."

"I do, but we just travelled through time, it's gotta be totally -"

"- [i]fine[/i] actually! Which - I was not expecting. I thought it would be wrecked. Hmm, 7:15, thank you satellites. That puts us what? Half an hour back?"

[k]"About that,"[/k] says Kendra. 

"That's good. The closer the better."

[k]"Means we'll be here longer though. Less tension on the line."[/k]

[quote="abibiliboop"]Mmmm... blood splatter. This is going to go well for Amie's sanity (pretty old hat for B&K now)[/quote]

[quote="star2wars3"]Is that blood on the floor there?[/quote]

[k]"And now we follow the blood trail,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"Does this mean we [i]finally[/i] get our Junior Detective badges?"[/k]
