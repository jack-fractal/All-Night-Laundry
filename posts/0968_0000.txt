Eurgh, maybe. How do you deal with a problem if you can't even trust your own thoughts about it though?

[e]"Hey!"[/e] calls Elizabeth from the other room.

[k]"Yeah?"[/k]

[e]"Is it time travel?"[/e]

[k]"What?"[/k]

[e]"The thing. The thing you won't tell me about. Is it time travel? You - uh - you mentioned it before, down in the construction site."[/e]

Well it can't hurt.

[k]"No, the thing I'm not telling you about isn't the time travel stuff."[/k]

There's a pause.

[k]"We're actually going to do some in a minute."[/k]

[e]"Some what?"[/e]

[k]"Time travel."[/k]

There is a longer pause. 

Kendra is starting to wonder if she's going to respond when she hears, [e]"Err... right. Good. I'd... like to see that."[/e]

OK, at least [i]this[/i] is a problem she can solve.

Wait...

Her thought before, about how maybe the Botfly is just trying to communicate... that can't be true. 

[quote=curiousFellow;7883835]>But the botfly talked to Gregor, didn't it? It gave him instructions so he could harm you.[/quote]

It can communicate. It already [i]is[/i].

Hmm... that's something to think about. The person who knows the most about the Botfly isn't Bina, not even the version of her who is/was B3. It's [i]Gregor[/i]...

[quote=Dave]Typos.[/quote]
Thank you. Last night was [i]not fun[/i]. I had just finished up going over the light language polish I like to do on my scripts before I start drawing when I managed to hit 'Alt+F' 'C' and then Enter all somehow in a single gesture when moving my hand. Still not sure how I did that, but I had to rewrite the whole thing. Even with something as short as my updates, that's always depressing.
