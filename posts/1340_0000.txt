"So this is like... your TARDIS console?"

"Yeah! Except it's a [i]real[/i] console, like, a programming one."

"It's nice..." says Amie.

"It's made of light!" says Bina. "Hard light!"

"I know! I said it's very nice."

"You had a tone."

"It's just - the Doctor Who consoles had [i]style[/i], you know? All the dials and the wooshy thing?"

"This one has style! I wrote it in jQuery!"

"Oh, yeah." says Emmie. "I forgot to mention. Your cop friend is all right as well."

[k]"What? Oh! Right, yeah, all of that,"[/k] Kendra wipes water from her forehead. [k]"Jeeze. I'd almost forgotten."[/k]

"Bunch of scrapes, and what is going to turn out to be some [i]spectacular[/i] bruises, but she's fine."
