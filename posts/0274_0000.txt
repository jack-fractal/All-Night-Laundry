[quote=AScWCC;7499837]I think the idea is to change the room so that everything is as Kendra saw it when she was tied up, so they won't be temporally obligated to be there anymore to do the changing, so they are allowed by the 'rules' to go back.

Man, that's [i]so simple.[/i][/quote]

"Yes! Just trust me we don't have much time!"

[k]"OK! Uhhh..."[/k]

"Hurry up!"

[quote=Gimeurcookie;7499985]> Take the bag on the desk[/quote]

[k]"I am hurrying! Uhhh... the bag. That - that wasn't there."[/k]

"Little clock, little clock, I don't see it. Do you see it?"

[k]"I don't see it."[/k]

They both start looking.

How do you hide [i]anything[/i] in a room this small?

[quote=tronn;7500051]Also also, she looks just gosh darn [i]adorable[/i] in that first panel![/quote]

Thanks! That one turned out really good. Poor hopeful Bina. It sure WOULD have been great if Kendra had been going to school to be a Time Lord.
