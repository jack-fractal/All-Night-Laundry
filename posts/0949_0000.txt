[k]"I'm going to check your temperature again, ok?"[/k]

"K-kay."

Kendra goes to get the thermometer.

[k]"Open."[/k]

[quote="xooxu"]Might as well fill her in since she's awake. She likes being informed and will be happy to hear Elizabeth is awake.[/quote]

[k]"Elizabeth is awake."[/k]

"Mhhhrm?!"

[k]"Yeah. She's got at least a pretty nasty concussion, but she's up and talking. She actually sorta ran away on me but she's OK and I talked her down."[/k]

"Mhhhmphmmprhphmprh!"

[k]"She's downstairs making friends with a bottle of gatoraid and the rest of the whisky. She lost a lot of blood and is a little loopy."[/k]

"Mhrm?"

[k]"Yeah! We have gatoraid! It surprised me too."[/k]

"Mmmmmmrm."

[k]"Yeah, well, I think she's just humouring me right now because she isn't really in a state to fight. God, I have no idea how to explain any of this to her. I can barely explain the time travel stuff to myself, and the botfly just makes all of this sound so [i]crazy[/i]... and the naughts? The Hound? How do I explain any of that to someone? She's going to think I'm a crazy person."[/k]

"Hmmmphmnt!"

[k]"What? Here, gimme that. It should be done by now."[/k]

Up half a degree from when Kendra put her to bed. Judging by the fact she's still shiverring, her fever hasn't stopped climbing. 

That's... not an encouraging sign.

[k]"What were you trying to say?"[/k]

"S-s-shouldn't t-t-tell her."
