It's the light from the window.

[quote="meganopteryx"]> And who are you, Bina, that Lash wouldn't like you? Maybe she does.[/quote]

She does, I think. Maybe. She keeps saying she does.

"I do."

But she doesn't understand. I'm just [i]me[/i]. Do you see? I'm just [i]Bina[/i].

[quote="Beastnix"]>I need some air. so jump out a window, it's a dream right, you won't hit the ground[/quote]

I have a balcony. I don't need to jump again...

I remember this! It is super cool, but like I decided at the start of this thing to not count resubmissions as part of the contest because I couldn't be sure I'd be able to track down everyone who submitted artwork and it wouldn't really be fair. 

Still! It is very cool. Thank you again! :pleasant:

[quote="Wessolf27"]Here's my submission :D (Warning for flashing images)

(In a different reality...)

For everyone else who was thinking of entering the draw, you have today and tomorrow left!
