"I really [i]can[/i] walk you know. I walked really far."

"No I haven't!"

[k]"You were [i]snoring[/i]."[/k]

"I was?"

"Your hair smells nice. I like it."

[k]"Uh... thanks, I think. I call that particular fragrance 'eau de hazmat'."[/k]

"And your shoulders are nice."

[k]"Uh..."[/k]

[quote="tegerioreo"]BUT ... there's no way you're getting Bina up the ladder in her present condition.[/quote]

[k]"I don't suppose you'd be up to climbing a [i]ladder[/i] in the immediate future."[/k]

"Would that involve [i]effort[/i]?"

[k]"Yes."[/k]

"Then I'm thinking, probably no."

[quote="a52"]Speaking of, what kinds of time travel cause seizures? We've only seen one seizure happen so far, and that time it was rather ambiguous exactly what happened, and what caused the time travel. (and the retcon for that time may not be complete either)[/quote]

I know a lot of people are confused about this. I have a plan for a bit more exposition on the topic in the immediate future.
