That explains so much...

[quote=Lots]<Very valid points about updating less frequently but with larger updates.>[/quote]

Were I starting an adventure today, or offering advice to another artist I would suggest that they work that way, with larger blocks composing a complete moment. That, or use an art style so simple and fast that you can create a large number of images in a very short time period, like RubyQuest. 

It's not an option for me. I made a deal with myself that I'd do the daily updates thing until this was finished and I intend to stick with that.

I get that this update schedule isn't for everyone, and I think there are a fair number of people who do what royalPawn suggests and just don't follow along every day, and instead catch up with the thread intermittantly. 

I am super grateful to everyone who follows along in whatever method works for them. 

[quote="Unclever title"]Whew!  That was a rough couple of days... well from my perspective, or well the "roughness" from the characters' perspective and the "couple of days" from mine.

Excellent adventure, and I am excited for where it goes. I tend to always love a self consistent time travel story that doesn't just handwave everything away into "multiverse."

No commands as of yet, just waiting for when we open the Elizabeth Box.[/quote]

Hurray! Hallo Unclever Title! Thank you so much for catching up!
