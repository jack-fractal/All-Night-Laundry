[quote="Wessolf27"]What sort of voices, do they sound familiar, or do they sound dangerous?[/quote]

They sound [i]angry[/i]. After long experience listening to her Dad complain about contractors, Bina can identify a rant at fifty paces.

It's French, but the ranter's voice is unknown to her. There are a few murmurs from another lower voice.

Bina concentrates on listening. 

"I'm just saying," says the first voice, it sounds as though it's got a good rhythm going. 

"You've been saying it for a good ten minutes already."

The second voice is dry and has an unfamiliar accent. 

"I'm just [i]saying[/i] she could stand to think about how her actions affect other people sometimes."
