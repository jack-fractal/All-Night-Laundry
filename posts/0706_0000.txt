No kidding.

They've seen one or two, but just early on. It doesn't look like the scientists made it out this way very often. They've seen few traces of them. The footing is bad, and most of the buildings are far from intact.

Still, if the map is right, they should be moving into the middle of Sector 3 right about now and aha - there's one.

Kendra spots a bright orange flag in the murk as she jogs past.

"Hey!" says Bina from up ahead, "I think we're getting close."
