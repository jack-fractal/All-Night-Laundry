Huh, yeah these ARE toilets aren't they? Hmm, she could maybe -

Kendra goes to check her cellphone for the time and realizes in sequence that: 

[list=2]
[*]She is wearing a hazmat suit over her pants and thus cannot access her pockets.
[*]The pants she is wearing are not HER pants and thus are unlikely to contain her cellphone.
[*]The cellphone wouldn't be in her pants anyway because the bastard with the shovel took it, as well as her radio and her wallet when he first grabbed her. 
[*]He probably left them in the danged laundromat, which means that they've all probably pulverized by thousands of tons of terrible architecture.
[/list]
Eurgh! That just tears it!

On top of everything else, she's going to have to buy a new [i]phone[/i]. And her ID! Like, ALL of her ID! 

The forms are always such a hassle and... 

Focus Kendra. Now is not the time. 

Anyway, they'd agreed to try to rendezvous again in an hour, then, if another hour had passed, to make a lot of noise in case the other had gotten lost.

It's only been... twenty minutes? Maybe less? Since she'd seen Bina?

Something like that.

She's got a few minutes.

[quote="tronn"]>Kendra: Toilets you say? Perhaps you should go, there's no telling when you'll get a chance again. It's not like any Shadow People would appear while you're there sitting with your pants around your ankles, that would be [i]rude.[/i][/quote]

Besides, it looks like Bina's right about the gribblies following [i]her[/i] and not Kendra.

Kendra hasn't seen hide nor hair of anyone or anything, spooky or otherwise, since she and Bina went their separate ways.

She hopes Bina's all right.
