[quote="Ploogle"]Is anyone else seeing static for the latest page image?[/quote]

Hah! Someone [i]did[/i] notice! I was sure I'd pulled it off without anyone seeing anything. I switched over the image host today, so there were a few minutes there with some weirdness with the latest-page and saved-page images.

Everything [i]should[/i] be working now.

[quote="nonchalantAnemone"]Hey everyone, I started [url="http://all-night-laundry.wikia.com/wiki/All_Night_Laundry_Wiki"]a wiki[/url] because I thought it would be useful to help organize information, and I don't think there is one anywhere else. It's a little bare at the moment, but hopefully it will fill out in time!

Please feel free to add pages/ content/ images/ citations or anything to help get it started out.[/quote]

[quote="DaffGrind"]Hey everyone, just a reminder that All Night Laundry now has its very own wiki. It's a little bare at the moment, but hopefully it will fill out in time!

This is awesome! Thank you so much for doing this nonchalantAnemone and everyone else who has been working on the Wiki so far.

I saw on there that people had noticed that Kendra's last name hasn't come up in the comic yet. I haven't been doing that intentionally, I just haven't found a natural place to do it.

It is 'Valcourt', for the record.
