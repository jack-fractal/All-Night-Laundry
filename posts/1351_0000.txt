"Is there coffee left?"

"Eeeyup!"

"Can I help with breakfast?"

"Can you mash bananas?"

"The green ones?" asks Emmie. "Are you sure?"

"They're for the batter, what else are we going to use them for?"

"That is a good point," says Emmie, pouring himself another cup of coffe. "I'll make you a deal, I will mash these bananas provided you sit down and take your weight off that foot."

"I am making [i]waffles[/i]!"

"Do you have an as yet undescovered medical condition that makes you incapable of stirring waffle batter while sitting down?"

Bina sighs, Emmie can be very annoying at times.
