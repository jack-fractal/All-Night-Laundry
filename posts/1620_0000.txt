"Because - just - jeeze! So many things! You're her, but [i]not[/i] her and I'm having way more empathy for Ben and Polly then I thought I ever would!"

"No! Me! Let me tell my story about me! About how I got here, stop interrupting!"

"Okay..."

"OK?"

"Yes!" says Bina, sounding a little annoyed.

"YES! You're doing the thing again!"

"OK, I'll just... I'll just be quiet."
