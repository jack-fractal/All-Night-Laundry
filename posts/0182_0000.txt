[quote="The One Guy"]> You're being paranoid about the support beam, it's making you thing it's getting worse when it really isn't.  It will break, yes, and when it does the whole place will come down, but it will happen suddenly, not with any sort of gradual creaks getting more frequent or anything like that to warn you.  That may not be much of a consolation, but it's just as likely to give out a few weeks from now as it is a few minutes from now.

Yeah that's the trouble. Clearly Gregor has been down here dozens of times. He must have been, with all the digging. 

Eurgh... her thoughts keep running in circles.

As Kendra keeps talking, Bina finds herself thinking the same thing over and over again. It's like she's [i]stuck[/i] on it. 

Gregor doesn't want to kill us. He wants us for something green.

Something [i]green[/i].

Why does she keep thinking that?

The thing in the sugar-factory courtyard is green. That memory pops up full and complete and clear as glass. Is that -

Oh! 

[quote=Beastnix;7403174]>wait a moment the green, it's still there. maybe that can fix your need to pee and the ability to speak.[/quote]

[quote=Akarai]Also, +1 reader. Wanted to catch up before I told you, but I read it all in a matter of a few days, and I'm LOVING it! :D[/quote]

Thank you so much for reading!

Do you mind if I ask, how long did it take you, in terms of hours, to read all of this? I have no real idea of how long this thing is...
