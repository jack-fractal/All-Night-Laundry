[quote=Bohandas;7895307]>But at least it looks normal outside, right? It's not like the end if [i]In the Mouh of Madness[/i] where he gets out and the world is ending?[/quote]

It looked mostly normal. Rainy and cold, but it was regular rain and cold. No... gribbly things.

[quote=Wessolf27;7895318]Bina: Take a rest, you'll need it after all the things you've been through.[/quote]

She doesn't want to rest. She wants to find the Botfly and punch it in the throat. She is [i]quite motivated[/i].

[quote=Andorxor;7895332]Do you see any living thing other than the tree or did Kendra build another moment?[/quote]

Err... that is a good question. Hmm, she can see a bit of the parking lot down there. If she waits... 

Bina spends about a minute watching the parking lot.

Hurray! Sitting! Sitting beats standing by a [i]fair margin[/i] in Bina's opinion.

Aha! Someone in a jacket walking to their car. OK, so that means this is probably the real world.

Probably.

Huh, that's unexpected. No lights, no power, no doctors... but she has a dial tone. Scratchy and full of static, but a dial tone none-the-less. 

She didn't really expect that to work. Who should she even call?
