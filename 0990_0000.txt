A reminder to anyone who missed it. The rules are thus: 

Anyone who posts artwork in this thread that meets the criteria of either being general All Night Laundry fanart OR art of their own characters doing laundry gets entered in the raffle. The winner of the raffle gets a copy of one piece of software from the Adobe Creative Cloud for a year, OR a copy of Clip Studio Paint. They are the best, and are what I use to draw All Night Laundry.
