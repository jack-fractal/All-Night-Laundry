- she's an [i]alien[/i]. 

A real, honest to god alien. The [i]only one[/i], and if what the Bina's and Gregor have said, just a baby, or the multidimensional insect equivalent. She's asleep, and unformed, or unfinished. You don't [i]kill[/i] something like that, it's just not [i]right[/i]. 

It's not how the story's supposed to go.
