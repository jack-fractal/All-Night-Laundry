[quote="Chimeric"]I think part of Amie's problem is that she's actually NOT the companion. At best, she's the tin dog.[/quote]

[quote="Volttekka"]Aaaaaaaaaaaaand finally caught up.

Whew, what a ride.
Just wanna say, it's always fun to watch the direct evidence of someone improving, both as an artist and as a storyteller.

How the FUCK is this still not over? Didn't you start this years ago? Admirable dedication, but seriously, wow.[/quote]

Hi Volttekka! Glad you've enjoyed reading, and it's always nice for people to see improvement. I still have trouble seeing it most days, because for me it's tiny incremental improvements over a huge amount of time.
