"Wouldn't it be easier for you to just, you know, NOT kill everyone!?"

[quote=Kíeros;7645916]> Yeah, down lower seems safer for the moment.[/quote]

"Good idea. He's planning on killing you."

[k]"What a surprise! I think I might just have a heart attack and [i]die[/i] from that surprise."[/k]

"Did you just quote [i]Aladdin[/i] at me? [i]Now[/i]?! Is this really the [i]time[/i]?"

[k]"I'm sorry, it's a stress response! I didn't even realize I was doing it."[/k]

"Rrrright, OK. Did you pack the flash-lights?"

[k]"What?"[/k]

"The flash-lights! From the tent!"

[k]"Yes, they're in the backpack."[/k]

"Gimme one! I have an idea."[/size]

"Oooohkay, enough with the talking now. I going to move the thingy."

[k]"OK! I got it. Here."[/k]
