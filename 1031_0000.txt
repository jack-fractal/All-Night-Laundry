Group:  Get Bina to bed.

Bina: Protest weakly.[/quote]

"I really feel pretty OK."

"Bed. Now," says Melissa.

"All right."

"Where are the extra bandages? I'm going to have to replace the ones she's wearing."

[k]"Why?"[/k]

[quote=tegerioreo;7903097]Bina's knees:  Don't look right.[/quote]

"Because they're a mess."

[k]"I thought you said she hadn't bled through them."[/k]

"She hasn't, the [i]bandages[/i] are a mess. Where [i]are[/i] those spares?"

[k]"I don't know. I thought you took them with you when you went to check in with Doctor Whatshisname this morning."[/k]

"I did? Crap. I'll have to get some more."

[k]"Make sure to pick up some more antibiotics too, looks like there's no extras and the bag is almost empty."[/k]

"Really? Christ. I told Emmie to - all right, [i]and[/i] some more saline. Look, if Emmie gets back first, don't let him touch those bandages, he likes to pretend he's a doctor."

[k]"Technically [i]you're[/i] not a doctor either."[/k]

"[i]Technically,[/i] shut up."

[k]"See Bina? This is why [i]I[/i] was on the debating team and Melissa wasn't."[/k]

"And did our debate team ever [i]win[/i] anything?"

[k]"Touche,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"Well? Are you going to go get the stuff?"[/k]

"Yeah, sure, just keep her in bed. Don't let her go wandering around again."

"I'm [i]right here[/i]," says Bina, getting a bit sick of Melissa's habit of talking [i]about[/i] her and not too her.

"All right then," says Melissa. "[i]Stay in bed.[/i]"

Melissa manages to deliver that last sentence as though she were firing it from a nail-gun.

"Yes ma'am," says Bina.
