[quote=Chizita;7549323]Hey, Bina. Maybe you should move something in front of that door. I know that there were only scratches last time you told this story, but it's already changed your story before. And if it breaks you again, it might be able to find you again, sleeping in the foil bag.

(That is, assuming that I'm not wrong about this being what you were hearing behind the door earlier. it might be something else idk)[/quote]

[quote=meganopteryx;7549354]>do NOT open the door. Barricade it. Find another way out.[/quote]

"Lash, I know this is going to sound really crazy but we need to barricade the door. Like, right now."

[color=#C10087]"What?"[/color]

"Like RIGHT NOW!"

[color=#C10087]"OK."[/color]

This kind of thing is at least half of why I fall in love with Laashya. She doesn't know what's going on, but she trusts me, and she doesn't hesitate.

Outside the door I hear the clatter of broken time hitting the floor. I wonder for a second if the security deposit on this place appartment covers giant undead time dogs.

Probably not.

I haul Lash off the floor by the chain of the handcuffs and the two of us half drag, half carry her dresser in front of the door.
