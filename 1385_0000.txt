[quote="Liam White"]Don't. If you go back any further than one loop, and you cause ANYTHING to change, you are resetting two universes. The amount of seizures you will feel would be enormous.
Plus, what if you change it so that, say, B7 stops the loops from happening and she wins? You then wouldn't exist.[/quote]

No, it's a terrible idea. Even if they could do it - and they probably [i]can't[/i] - it's [i]way[/i] too dangerous.

None of the other Bina's beat the Botfly anyway, so what they were doing doesn't matter as anything other then examples of things [i]not[/i] to do...

Right?

After a few moments of thought, Bina decides that she's right and that she should try to get some sleep.
