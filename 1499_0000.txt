"OK! Well, we'd better setup. You think we should do it out here or inside?"

[k]"Inside I think,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"No need to get even more rained on."[/k]

Nobody points out that Kendra is, by far, the least drenched of all of them, having only sacrificed her umbrella mere moments ago. 

"Setup? Where [i]are[/i] we? Better question, [i]when[/i] are we?" asks Amie.

[k]"Oh we're [i]now[/i],"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"If the green team gets to use time travel as teleportation, so do we."[/k]

"And as for [i]where[/i] we are..." says Bina. "Look behind you. It should be obvious."

"We're on the mountain. I thought we could use a little space, and like I said - no sewers."

>>>NOTES:

A note for people who don't live in Montreal: Yes, there is actually a mountain here. It's quite nice. 

There's apparently a pond at the top? I just learned that today.
