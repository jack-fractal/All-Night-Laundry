There's a pause. Bina considers various ways of broaching the subject when Kendra says, [k]"You want to try to save Elizabeth."[/k]

[quote=wolftamer9;7776549]> But... you can save Elizabeth if you go back![/quote]

"Nnnoo...?"

[k]"Binaaa,"[/k] says Kendra, exasperation in her voice.

"We have to at least [i]try[/i]! Her and the science guys setting up the sandbags! Gregor gets them too!"

[k]"We [i]can't[/i]!"[/k]

"I know!"

[k]"And I'm not convinced those flash-light batteries are going to last long enough to get us across the [i]factory[/i], let alone-"[/k]

"I know that too!" says Bina.

[k]"I'm guessing there's a 'but' coming up."[/k]

"But we can't just let her die [i]again[/i]!" says Bina, "We [i]can't[/i]."
