[quote="Dave Rapp"]What would you accomplish by doing so?[/quote]

"Why?" asks Amie. "It's not like we can do anything to her."

"No," says Bina. "Probably not, but we might be able to stop her from creating a lot of paradox."

[k]"Is that actually a bad thing?"[/k] asks Kendra.

[k]"I mean, if she creates too much paradox, won't she just [i]die[/i]? I mean, it's sad, she's a dog, and probably doesn't really know what she's doing, but she's also a horrible monster."[/k]

"Not necessarily," says Bina.

[k]"Not a bad thing or not a monster?"[/k]

"No, I mean, she's not necessarily the one who suffers the paradox."

[k]"What?"[/k]

"Paradox doesn't ground through the person who causes it." 

[k]"Oh... right."[/k]

"It happened to you, AND you read all my journals!"

[k]"I didn't read [i]all[/i] of them - but - crap!"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"She only suffers the paradox if she changes her [i]own[/i] past, right?"[/k]

"Yeah. Remember when we went back and you hit me with a phone and then we got the backpack that Twelve left us? We forgot to change something in the office, which made a paradox. I was fine, because I'd never gone in there, but you -"

[k]"- passed out. Yeah. So if she changes [i]our[/i] past -"[/k]

"- we get hit."

[k]"We have to go after her,"[/k] groans Kendra.

"We do, in fact, have to go after her," agrees Bina.

"Oh goodie..." says Amie. "This sure is a great idea... yay!"
