[quote=xooxu;7592987]>You probably need the shard/wood to get to the Moment. Fetch it.[/quote]
[quote=Medinoc;7592696]>You'll need all the weird stuff "on your side" you can get; go fetch it.[/quote]
[quote='?[GimeurCookie];7592913']> Get that shard. It'll be important later on, you just know it.[/quote]

"I really think we're going to need it."

[quote=meganopteryx;7592890]Go get time shard. It seems important. But don't spend too long looking for it if you can't find it quickly.[/quote]

[k]"All right,"[/k] Kendra does not sound convinced. [k]"But we can't spend too long looking for it, ok?"[/k]

"I know. If we can't find it right away we'll leave it."

[k]"Right, and you're wearing the blanket."[/k]

"What?"

[k]"You're wearing the blanket. I'm not letting you get hypothermia again."[/k]

"Fine, but I'm [i]also[/i] wearing the backpack and you're leaning on me until we find some walking-sticks."

[k]"Hey! It wasn't [i]my[/i] legs that gave out just now."[/k]

"Can you swear to me that your head is 100% better?"

[k]"All right, all right! Fine. How many of the hotpads do we have left?"[/k]

"Uh... one, two - uh, including the one I'm using now, four of the little ones. There was only one of the big ones, and that one's all used up."

[k]"OK. Pack them up. Lets go."[/k]
