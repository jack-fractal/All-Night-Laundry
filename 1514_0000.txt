[quote="Huh"]Just read this all the way through! It only took me two full days.
Love this story. The plot? The characters? The mechanics? The art frequently changing? The player interaction? All great. I have no clue why I haven't seen this before.
I'll have to stay up to date on this.[/quote]

As for why you haven't heard of it, first, there's lots of webcomics out there. There's lots of [i]great[/i] webcomics out there... and I am not super great at self promotion.

If you wanted to tell all yours pals about it, that [i]would[/i] be cool!
