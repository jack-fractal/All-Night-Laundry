[k]"If that thing turns off, does that mean everyone comes back? I mean, they're time travelling, right? So-"[/k]

"They'll have caught up though," says Bina. "With their primary temporal position, like Amie did. If the trip lasts long enough for you to catch up with yourself then-"

[k]"Then the tension breaks and you don't go back,"[/k] says Kendra.

[k]"Right... but they'd come back if that were infinitesimally in the [i]future[/i] right? Rather than infinitesimal in the [i]past[/i]?"[/k]

Bina has to think about that. "Uh... yeah, I guess. I mean, the time machine would still be moving forwards, but you'd be moving forwards [i]with[/i] it. I [i]think[/i] it would work. You'd still be under tension, so when your vector got unstable enough you'd snap back."

"Of course, that would be really stupid, because [i]don't mess with the future[/i] and also why would he set it up that way? He'd lose all his captives when the machine went down."

[k]"I don't think [i]he[/i] would."[/k]
