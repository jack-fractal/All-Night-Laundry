"Hah!" says Amie, more of a gasp then a laugh.

Thanks Dave!

I think some of these (like the gif one) are technologically tricky. I like the idea of a "this event created a retcon" buttons on the pages where they trigger, that's a good idea. I was thinking of changing the archive page so that you could see the retcon pages in the archive and possibly having a 'I want to see everything' button for people who don't want to mess around with slow reveals. 

Doing things the traditional way is something I want to avoid, mainly 'cause it is the big gimmick and also because, like in this case, spending three days working over content we've already seen would be pretty dull.

I think the archive and the back-trace links would probably do it as far as clarity goes. Thanks again Dave!

[quote="Aherea"]No. Noooo! I'm caught up! Now I have to wait like everyone else. Woe is me.

Anyway, this is definitely one of the best comics I've ever read. +1 reader.[/quote]
