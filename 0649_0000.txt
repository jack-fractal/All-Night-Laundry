They neither notice nor care.

[k]"Ha *cough* *gasp* ha haaaaa! We did it!"[/k], says Kendra, struggling back to her feet and trying to get her breath back.

"Take [i]that[/i] you creepy time zombie bastards!"

Bina is pleased to realize that she has, somehow, managed to hold onto her hammer.

[k]"I built a time machine,"[/k] says Kendra. Then she says it again, [k]"I built a time machine and it [i]worked[/i]!"[/k]

"You totally did!"

[k]"I built a time machine and it totally worked! I can't believe it worked!"[/k]

"It totally did! Aaaa!"
