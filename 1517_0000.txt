Hmm... this phone is used a bunch around this period of time, and it's possible that call logs might be paired if she uses it here. 

That's the kind of little detail that can lead to your cerebellum decorating the local shrubbery if you're not careful.

She turns the phone off.

Kendra's only been here once before, and it had been coated in tourists at the time. Now, it's all quiet and rain. Still, the lights are on, she should at least try the doors.
