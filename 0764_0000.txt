[k]"Hey, so maybe we should go back to the house before you start - oh."[/k]

"What?" asks Bina, her mouth full of sandwich. 

[k]"Nothing. Enjoy your sandwich."[/k]

"It's is really good!"

[k]"Right uh… look, is - did you figure out your thing?"[/k]

Bina swallows a chunk of sandwich.

"Not really," she sighs and wipes her mouth. "I just - I keep going in circles."

[k]"It's not uh… it's not [i]me[/i] is it?"[/k]

[k]"Is it that I'm here?"[/k]

"What!? No. Kendra, no."

[k]"Then what is it? Because I'm confused and you're kind of scaring me."[/k]

"I'm not going to freak out or- "

[k]"No, Bina, I'm not scared [i]of[/i] you. I'm scared because [i]you're[/i] scared."[/k]

"Jumped out of helicopters?"

[k]"My parents were coastguard. Didn't I tell you?"[/k]

"No. You said your Dad drove a helicopter but - [i]both[/i] of them?"

[k]"Well yeah, but-"[/k]

"Wait - hold on - your Dad drove a helicopter and your Mom [i]jumped out of it[/i]."

[k]"Yes."[/k]

"But you're [i]afraid of heights[/i]?"

Bina tries to keep the laughter out of her voice and very nearly manages it.

[k]"Yes! OK? Trust me. I am [i]well aware[/i] of the irony. What was I saying?"[/k]

"You were-

[k]"Right! Look, if [i]you're[/i] scared then it's something [i]I should be concerned about[/i]. OK?"[/k]

"All right! Fine! I'll tell you! Jeeze..."
