"OK, so we definitely should list off all the stuff that the other Bina's were doing. Do you have the list?"

[k]"Yeah,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"But first, we're going to have to figure out how we even move between loops. The other Binas used the Viewers to do that, but Three made them non-functional in our loop, and then you went and smashed a big hole in them with a hammer."[/k]

"I only smashed one of them!" says Bina.

[k]"Right of course,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"That makes it all better then."[/k]

"Didn't Twelve know this one?" asks Emmie.

"What?"

"The intra-loop time travel thing. She wrote a book about it."

Emmie pauses, then says, "Why are you all looking at me like that?"

"She wrote a [i]book[/i] about it!?"

"Um, yes, I - I mean I think so," says Emmie, who is having a hard time in this conversation. "I'm not entirely sure, but I was looking through the notebooks yesterday, the ones about the mechanics of time travel, and there was a small blue one by Twelve. It was filled with notes about intra-loop travel and communication as well as a lot of conspiracy theories about the third Bina..."

"Ooooooh!" says Bina. "The one we got from the truck!"

[k]"I never actually read that one,"[/k] says Kendra. [k]"I mean - not all the way through.[/k]

"Meee neither," admits Bina. "I just put it with the other time travel primers."

[k]"We should probably read it,"[/k] says Kendra.

"Yes! We definitely should!"

[quote="smurtfton"]Amie: but back to my question...Why do we have to kill the 'fly?[/quote]

"Wait - just, can we talk about the killing the Botfly thing please?" says Amie.
