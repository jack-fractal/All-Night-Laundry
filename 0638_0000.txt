"OK, so how do we do this thing?" asks Bina.

Kendra stands up. [k]"OK, uhh... all right. So I have these two thingies here, and this wire. Using these, I uh... I sort of 'dial in' towards a weak spot. I have to get the right frequency and then... and the book is really vague on this, the way opens and we go through."[/k]

"How much do you want to bet it involves jumping?"

[k]"What?"[/k]

"Just thinking ahead."

[k]"I've been wondering. I mean - you've done this before. Last time, with the TV. How did you follow me?"[/k]

"I used a brick."

[k]"A brick?"[/k] Kendra's voice is flat.

"Yeah, about that - there's a whole buncha stuff that I just learned from a ghost. I think it's pretty important. We should talk about it, but we can do that later."

[k]"Rrright."[/k]

"What are we waiting for?" 

[k]"Do we have everything?"[/k]

"I've got my hammer!"

[k]"Grab the backpack."[/k]

"Kay!"

[k]"Don't forget the clippers, and the flash-light!"[/k]

"OK! What now?"

[k]"You need to do the whole glowey-arm thing."[/k]

"Oh! Yeah, that makes sense. I can use the flash-light."

[k]"You can?"[/k]

"Yeah its - it's kinda weird. It's like, I just need to hold the flash-light in my spooky hand and it makes with the green stuff."

[k]"That doesn't make any - [/k]

"You know, we're probably going to be more productive if we just remove 'That doesn't make any sense' from our vocabularies for the next few hours."

[k]"You... have a point."[/k]
