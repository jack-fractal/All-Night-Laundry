[k]"Aaaah crap, looks like they had some people guarding this entrance. [i]'Had'[/i] being the operative word here - Wait! Amie don't -"[/k]

[k]"You know, it's probably OK, at this point. Bina! What are you doing?"[/k]

"Hmm? Oh, I'm um - I thought maybe there would be some useful stuff... in this box."

[k]"Is there?"[/k]

"Do we need an industrial fire extinguisher?"

[k]"No."[/k]

"What about a bunch of fire retardant blankets?"

[k]"Are they big enough to block the tunnel?"[/k]

"Not even close!"

[k]"Great! Wait - is there any tape? This stuff is all full of gravel. I dunno if it'll stick properly again."[/k]

"I don't see any... there's a bucket? Does that help?"

[k]"No! Get over here!"[/k]

"I have something in my foot!"

[k]"Then get it out of your foot and [i]then[/i] get over here!"[/k]
