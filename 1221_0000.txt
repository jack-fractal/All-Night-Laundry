"Aren't those the police who were downstairs with us?" asks Emmie, pointing over his shoulder as Kendra pulls the curtain closed. 

[k]"Yeah but... well I need - look, this thing - it's a little sketchy and I don't want to get anyone in trouble."[/k]

"I have a feeling I know what you're going to say, but - I have to ask you something first."

[k]"Anything,"[/k] says Kendra, but she knows what he's going to ask.

"What... what did I see down there, before your friend grabbed me? What was that thing?"

[k]"They were naughts,"[/k] she says, feeling out each syllable, hoping [i]this[/i] is the question he's asking but knowing she's wrong. [k]"They're Gregor's minions. We think maybe he makes them from dead people and-"[/k]

"No," says Emmie. "Not that. I - I know what those were. What did I [i]see[/i] Kendra?"
