What if she saw where she was going [i]because[/i] Kendra was there.

Because when Kendra jumped, she expected to be able to see where she was going to land.

Because, unlike herself, Kendra is the kind of person who looks before she leaps.

Usually. 

Bina thinks she might have been a bad influence there.

Don't think.

(because if you think you'll be paralysed)

Don't look.

(because if you look, something might be looking back at you)

Just jump.

For her, it's always been the only way to do it.
