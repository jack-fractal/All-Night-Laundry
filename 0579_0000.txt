"But - 

[k]"Look, I don't want that thing to wake up any more then you do, OK? It is superbly bad news, I know, I get it. Remember all of [i]my[/i] alter egos? They're all dead. No notes or journals from them, and all of that? And all of [i]this[/i] it is, to be quite honest, scaring the pants off me.

[quote=xooxu;7722091]>If Bina is even capable of sitting up like that, there's a very good chance that her ribs are bruised or cracked (like a stress fracture) and not broken.

[k]"BUT! If I find that one of your ribs is floating, or shattered, or your sternum is cracked, we are going to the subway, and we are getting you some help. The goddam botfly will just have to wait. OK?"[/k]
