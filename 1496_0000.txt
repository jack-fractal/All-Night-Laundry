Behind them, there comes a chiming shattering noise that, while not loud, is [i]penetrating[/i] in a way that normal sound is not. The sound, were they in a position to identify it, is the precise sound one would get if one folded time and space together, and then hit it very hard with a hammer in the shape of a pocket watch. 

It is a pretty sound, but somehow horrible, like watching a creature, majestic and beautiful, being strangled to death.

"You know? Maybe we should just run!"

"Ya think!?" says Wong.

And so they did.
