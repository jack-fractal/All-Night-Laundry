Good plan, it would be pretty crappy if she lost some important detail to the rain. Pity about that umbrella, it was really nice...

[quote="GarryAlways"]All right Kendra, where exactly were you going to read your book in the rain, at night, on top of a mountain?[/quote]

Well, she wasn't planning on overthinking it. At least, not until now. She was just going to use the large, conveniently located, public building.

You know, this one.

She could try to find one that was further away, but that seems like maybe not the best use of her time.
