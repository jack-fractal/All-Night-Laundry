"Did you get... the thingy?"

[k]"Yes. Yes, I got it. Here, take it. Please. I don't want it."[/k]

Bina who, with extraordinary effort, had just managed to flop onto her back, feels the smooth buzzing thing land on her stomach. 

She picks it up.

Ftfy. Was I the only one that was afraid that the[i] green glowing tv[/i] was going to have some adverse affect on Kendra?[/quote]

"Are you ok?" she says, all her anger at Kendra smothered by a ice-like stab of fear, "Did you cut yourself?! You didn't get any IN you did you?"

She trails off. 

[k]"All this time stuff, it messes with your head, right?"[/k]
