[k]Do you know this guy? The russian guy? What does he want? Is he going to kill us?[/k]

Bina pauses, she's not really sure how to answer that question. Gregor appears to be capable of murder. She feels certain of that, though her fragmented memory won't cough up a definitive reason for [i]why[/i] she's so certain.

Even so, she's pretty sure that what Gregor wants the two of them for is something else. 

Something different. Something... [i]green[/i].

[k]It's not a... you know?[/k]

Bina doesn't know.

After a few moments of what appears to be internal debate Kendra sighs.

[k]It's not a [i]sex[/i] thing is it?[/k]

Oooooh... [i]that[/i]. 

To that, at least, Bina can shake her head. It is not a sex thing. She's sure enough of that.

[quote=Anthano]> She wouldn't happen to know how that big russian lug got in here, would she? Or more importantly, how he gets out?[/quote]

[k]It's just... he went down that hole about half an hour ago with a bunch of serial murderer plastic. Like from Dexter? You know? The big rolled up sheets. I [i]really[/i] don't want to find out what his plans are with those.[/k]
