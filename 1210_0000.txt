[quote="Wolph Strykes"]Kendra... you ASKED Amie for help.[/quote]

"Hey! [i]You[/i] asked for help," says Amie. 

[k]"Yeah, but - you could be a little nicer about it."[/k]

"I thought it was best just to get it over with, you know, like ripping off a band-aid," says Amie.

"Wait! Shut up! This isn't a thing. I don't want time travel!"

[quote="Juddy555"]>She has a point Bina. After all, I bet you keep thinking "If I could go back and fix this..." with everything you do that goes even slightly wrong, especially with Lash.[/quote]

"You never wanted to go back in time and fix stuff?" asks Amie.

"OK - OK maybe!" says Bina, holding up a hand placating. "But no, it's still not a thing because A, hasn't [i]everyone[/i] wanted to do that at some point? And B - and this is [i]important[/i] - I [i]hate[/i] time travel! I really hate it!"

[quote="david Jung"]AAAAAH I READ THE WHOLE THING FROM THE BEGINNING AND I'M FINALLY HERE TO SAY
+1 reader! Love everything that's going on. This took like a month XD I can understand and speak Korean (you asked this like 600 panels ago) and I came here from an advertisement (see, it does work!). Can't wait to see how this all wraps up :P[/quote]

Hi David! Aaaa! I'm glad you enjoyed yourself! I'm very interested in seeing how this all wraps up myself. :)
