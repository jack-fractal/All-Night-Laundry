[quote=a52;7749349]How is Bina even still alive anyway?[/quote]

Bina's been asking herself that for a while. Memories of the previous night are skittering around the edges of her mind. Did she [i]really[/i] jump off of a crane? That was... not her best idea. 

[quote=tegerioreo;7749341]Everybody jump out and yell "SURPRISE" when Bina opens that door.  Cupcakes and punch all around!!

No seriously:  Kendra has things pretty much in control.  By which I mean she's just barely managing to fend them off.[/quote]

If Kendra is fighting wigglies back here, she's dedicated to her 'not making noise' policy to an uncomfortable degree.

Bina works her way around the front of the truck.

[k]"What are you doing standing up!?"[/k] Kendra mouths at Bina. 

Bina shrugs. She's not really sure. She doesn't feel [i]that[/i] bad.

Kendra looks around quickly then motions to her and whispers, [k]"Look, if you're going to stand there, help me get this in front of the door!"[/k]
