"OhgodIwokeupandyouweren'tthereandIwasreallyscaredandyouweren'tthereandItriedtocallAmiebutshedidn'tanswerandIthoughtmaybeImeanIthought, I thought they were coming for me - I mean, I - god I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm getting snot all over your shirt. Oh... gosh, I'm crying, why am I crying?"

"I was about to ask [i]you[/i] that same question."
