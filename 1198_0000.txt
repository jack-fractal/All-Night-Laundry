"Could it be from another you?" asks Amie. "Like, Bina's had all these copies of her and-"

[k]"My other iterations are dead,"[/k] says Kendra. 

"Not all of them!" says Bina. "Some of them just went home."

[k]"I mean - the ones who got involved - they're - the ones who were in the basement. Look, it's complicated Amie. It's going to be from actually [i]me[/i] me."[/k]

"Hmm..." muses Amie. "OK, so maybe you knowing this would change your behavior and -"

[quote="Wolftamer9"]> C'mon Kendra, if you're gonna listen to anyone it should be your past self! Use your head here.[/quote]

[k]"No! Look, I'm not going to play mind-games like that with myself. I'd just tell myself what I needed to do and I'd do it."[/k]

"Yeah that - that sounds like a good policy," says Bina, and sighs. "A great policy, just - like - a really good idea."

[k]"It's gotta be something else..."[/k]

"What are you talking about?" asks Amie.

[k]"If you learn something in the future and then tell yourself in the past, you already [i]know[/i] it when you get to the future again and you don't have to learn it. You could send it into the past again but then [i]where does the information come from[/i]?"[/k]

"Paradox," says Bina. "A nasty one."

"Oooh!" says Amie, getting it. "So what you did was -"

[quote="smurfton"]Because your future self is good about predestination, and likes to allow more choice in the content of the letter than a guarantee. Also because your future self wants a metastable time loop.[/quote]

[k]"I learned whatever piece of information is in that message in the future, then I sent it back here [i]now[/i] so that one of [i]you[/i] can use it. I can't know what it is because I still need to learn it in the future. That way the information [i]comes[/i] from somewhere and - why are you grinning?"[/k]
