[FONT=Courier New][i][b]Image.[/b] Long shot. Bina striding down the laundromat toward Piotyr wagging a finger. She is now wearing the long t-shirt and jeans that she started tonight in. They are not covered in mud. Her right arm is wrapped in bandages. Behind her, Lash is skipping to catch up.[/i][/font]

"Stop that Piotyr. No. Don't give me those cute puppy-dog eyes. No! I am impervious to your adorably quivering eyebrows. You [i]know[/i] that you shouldn't be eating the weird static melty stuff! It is bad for you AND we are in the middle of being chased by past and/or possibly-future probably-you. We don't have [i]time[/i] for this. You are being a [i]bad girl[/i]! Drop it!"

[FONT=Courier New][i][b]Image. Medium Shot.[/b] Piotyr with static dripping from her chin. She is trying to look cute. Her eyes are very large and are reflecting the hanging ropes of static around her.[/i][/font]

"I said, [i]drop it[/i] puppy. [i]Now[/i]!"
