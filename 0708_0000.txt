"But none of them with the lettering on it!"

To that, Kendra says nothing.

"What?"

[k]"It's just..."[/k]

"What? Come on."

[k]"Bina, we've come all this way, and - we're back in time even - and we [i]still[/i] have no proof that this Moment thing is even going to be there, if the place that you [i]think[/i] is going to be in sector eight is even where you think it is and-"[/k]

"It's going to be there. Don't worry."

[k]"But what if isn't?"[/k]

"It [i]will[/i] be."

[k]"But [i]what[/i] if it [i]isn't[/i]?"[/k]

After a few moments, they move on, saying nothing.
