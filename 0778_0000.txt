[k]"Soooo you're really into this Lash person, huh?"[/k]

"Yeah. I mean. Uh, yeah..."

Oh god. Are they going to have this conversation now?

[k]"And they are youuuurr...?"[/k]

Welp. Better get this over with.

"Girlfriend."

Bina considers leaving it at that, but honesty makes her continue.

"Maybe. I don't know. We - eurgh. It's complicated. We kinda broke up again, for the third time, a couple of months ago. It was pretty bad. I mean, breakups are usually pretty bad but this one was bad even as breakups go."

Kendra makes a non-committal noise so Bina continues. 

"But then, like, last week, she messaged me on Skype out of nowhere, and we started talking again, and it was all, I don't know, [i]normal[/i] I guess. Nice. Really nice actually, because she's my best friend, and I - we hadn't even [i]talked[/i] since all the bad stuff happened and - anyway, she said she was coming to Montreal at the beginning of August and... I dunno. I dunno! I dunno what we are now."

[k]"[i]Girl[/i]friend?"[/k]

[i]This[/i] is what she picked up on. Great.

"Yeah."

[k]"So you're...?"[/k]

Bina debates briefly about leaving some ambiguity and decides against it.

"Gay. Yup. Super gay. That's me."

Please don't let this be a problem. [i]Please[/i] don't let this be a problem. You're so cool Kendra. Please be cool about this.

[k]"I'd kinda guessed."[/k]

"You had?"

Dammit.

[k]"Well you blush like your face is on fire every time I do so much as hand you a cup of coffee, so either you're deeply embarrassed by physical contact or-"[/k]

"Aaaaaargh..."

[k]"Sorry, but yeah. Just like that!"[/k]

"Nnnnnghhh!"

[k]"Hey! It's nothing to be ashamed of. It's cute."[/k]

"Aaaaugh!"

So [i]this[/i] went in a direction she didn't anticipate.
