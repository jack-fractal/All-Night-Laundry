[quote="gaeilal"]Gift Shop:> Have a relatively large selection of cards with envelopes in many colors. Kendra may have to buy a very goofy card to get the right color envelope, if it's not already in her pocket.[/quote]

>>>NOTES:

[quote="ClockworkBob"]A wild Timeline of Events has appeared on the Wiki. It's crude, sometimes speculative, a bit difficult to follow/navigate, but it is a working paraphrased list of events by date/time (not including retcons), dreams, trips to the Moment/Other Moment, and jumps through time.

It's a work in-progress, and will be made more presentable as time permits.[/quote]

This is extremely cool! I will definitely be using this myself... 

Thank you so much ClockworkBob!
