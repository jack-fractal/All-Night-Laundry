[size=8]"You going to run [i]towards[/i] the fricking monsters?"[/size]

[size=8]"Well,"[/size] says Amie [size=8]"Yeah. That's what we're here for, isn't it? What were you planning on doing?"[/size]

[size=8]"Well... uhh,"[/size] Edwards hesitates. [size=8]"Sneak up on them maybe? I hadn't really thought that far ahead."[/size]

[size=8]"What a surprise,"[/size] whispers Castillo. [size=8]"That [i]neeever[/i] happens."[/size]

[size=8]"We should really be calling for backup,"[/size] says Edwards.

[size=8][e]"If they were moving, they would be getting louder or quieter,"[/e][/size] explains Elizabeth in a whisper with what sounds to Amie like forced calm. [size=8][e]"They're not doing either, which means they're not moving."[/e][/size]
