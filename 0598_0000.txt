[quote=tegerioreo;7732800]Sniff the flowers.  MMmmm, they smell like fresh laundry dryer sheets![/quote]

I [i]would[/i] sniff the flowers, they look really nice, but they're a ways down the hull of the... sky... boat... thing.

A ways down with no safety railings, and below that, clouds, and below THAT a river, and fields. 

I am theenking that Kendra would not enjoy this place at all.

That river [i]might[/i] be the Saint Lawrence, but I don't see Montreal anywhere. If this is the real world, or some kind of reflection of it, I have no idea where I am.

[quote=tegerioreo;7732800]No no no no no, if you eat the food here then you can never leave.[/quote]

I've read enough fairy tales not to touch the food, which is a pity. It looks very tasty.
