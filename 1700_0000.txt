[quote="Rain Walker"]Did you hear that thing that just passed in the other hallway?[/quote]

She heard something, she pays close attention to where she's placing her feet.

What is she going to do if they grab her?

Probably just get grabbed. She should have picked up a weapon or something. That umbrella seemed to work pretty good, she wishes she had one of those. 

She'll just have to [i]not[/i] get grabbed. That's probably a better plan.

She hears the floor creak in one of the rooms, crouching down, she risks a quick look.

The room is completely trashed, the door is inside in several pieces and it looks like the ceiling has fallen in, but at least one of the naughts is inside. 

Great! That's... just great.
