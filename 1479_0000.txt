Hi Sam! Welcome to the PTP! That is a great way to describe catching up btw, I may steal that. Please stick around and make suggestions! 

[quote="Samara Shortridge"]I cought up... NNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO-
well shoot. What will I do instead of homework now?[/quote]

Do you have a pen because I have so many ideas!?

My first suggestion is Night in the Woods. It's part of the crop of unfairly amazing indie games that have come out this year and I highly recommend it for all your homework avoiding needs.

Also thank you for reading and welcome to the PTP!
